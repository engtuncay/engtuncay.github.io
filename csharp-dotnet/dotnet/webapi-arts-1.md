# What is Api.http file in .NET 8

It's a feature provided by Visual Studio 2022 for testing ASP.NET Core projects, particularly API applications. This file serves as a convenient way to send HTTP requests and view responses directly within Visual Studio.

The Visual Studio 2022 ".http" file editor allows you to create and update ".http" files within your project. These files can be used to define HTTP requests that you want to send to your API endpoints.

Within the ".http" file, you can specify the details of HTTP requests such as the URL, HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), headers, query parameters, request body, etc.

After sending a request from the ".http" file, Visual Studio displays the response directly within the editor. This allows you to view the response status code, headers, and body, making it easy to debug and test your API endpoints.

You can also check the completed Microsoft official documentation of using http files.
