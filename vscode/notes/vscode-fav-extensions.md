# Programming Languages or Frameworks

## Javascript

➖ Auto Import - Automatically finds, parses and provides code actions and code completion for all available imports (altough VSCode has auto import funcionatlity, this plugin is a great complement).

➖ Prettier - JavaScript formatter - format your Javascript / Typescript / CSS - specially for Angular, I recommend adding the following config in you users setting for VsCode. Recommended settings:



## TypeScript

➖ json2ts - Convert a JSON from clipboard to TypeScript interfaces. (Ctrl+Alt+V).

➖ TSLint - linter for the TypeScript language, help fixing error in TS code.

Recommended settings: "tslint.autoFixOnSave": true (auto fix lint issues on file save)

## Bootstrap 5


## Solidjs


## Vue


## Html

- Auto Rename Tag - Auto rename paired HTML/XML tag.

- Auto Close Tag - Automatically add HTML/XML close tag, same as Visual Studio IDE or Sublime Text.

- HTML Snippets - Full HTML tags including HTML5 Snippets.


# Debug

##  Debugger for Chrome

You can debug using chrome and add your breakpoints in VSCode. Tutorial on how to use can be found on VSCode docs.

# Productivity Extensions

"prettier.singleQuote": true (this helps when using auto import extension or the VSCode auto import functionality).
"prettier.tabWidth": 2 (angular lint uses 2 spaces as default indentation). With this setting, you can continue using tabs if it is your preference
"prettier.useTabs": false (same as above)

Path Intellisense - VSCode has a very good auto import capability, but sometime you still need to import some files manually, and this extension helps a lot in these cases.

Move TS - this is a great extension to help you refactor and re-organize some files and components in the project. It automatically fixes the imports on the file (or component folder) that is being moved and also files that are importing the component you are moving. To use it: right-click on a file or folder in the Project Explorer pane and select 'Move TypeScript'.

## Workbench

###  EditorConfig for VS Code - EditorConfig Support for Visual Studio Code

# Theme - Icons

Other extensions recommended, but not included in this package

➖  vscode-icons - my favorite collection of icons for VSCode projects!

# Productivity

➖ Bracket Pair Colorizer 

This extension allows matching brackets to be identified with colours. Great when you have nested brackets. I usually keep this extension disabled and only enable it when needed.

➖ snippet-creator 

helps you creating code snippets (saves snippets in the User Snippets in VSCode)


# Git

- Git History (git log) 

allows you to view git history with graph and details

# Deprecated Extensions
