# Intro

## What is XSL

XSL (eXtensible Stylesheet Language) is a styling language for XML.

XSLT stands for XSL Transformations.

This tutorial will teach you how to use XSLT to transform XML documents into other formats (like transforming XML into HTML).

**xml (data)**

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<catalog>
  <cd>
    <title>Empire Burlesque</title>
    <artist>Bob Dylan</artist>
    <country>USA</country>
    <company>Columbia</company>
    <price>10.90</price>
    <year>1985</year>
  </cd>
  <cd>
    <title>Hide your heart</title>

    <company>CBS Records</company>
    <price>9.90</price>
    <year>1988</year>
  </cd>
</catalog>
```

**xslt**

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

<xsl:template match="/">
  <html>
  <body>
    <h2>My CD Collection</h2>
    <table border="1">
      <tr bgcolor="#9acd32">
        <th>Title</th>
        <th>Artist</th>
      </tr>
      <xsl:for-each select="catalog/cd">
        <tr>
          <td><xsl:value-of select="title"/></td>
          <td><xsl:value-of select="artist"/></td>
        </tr>
      </xsl:for-each>
    </table>
  </body>
  </html>
</xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>

```

**html output**

```
<div id="result_output">

# XSL(T) Languages

XSLT is a language for transforming XML documents.

XPath is a language for navigating in XML documents.

XQuery is a language for querying XML documents.

## It Started with XSL

XSL stands for EXtensible Stylesheet Language.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) started to develop XSL because there was a need for an XML-based Stylesheet Language.

## CSS = Style Sheets for HTML

HTML uses predefined tags. The meaning of, and how to display each tag is well understood.

CSS is used to add styles to HTML elements. 

## XSL = Style Sheets for XML

XML does not use predefined tags, and therefore the meaning of each tag is not well understood.

A <table> element could indicate an HTML table, a piece of furniture, or something else - and browsers do not know how to display it!

So, XSL describes how the XML elements should be displayed.

## XSL - More Than a Style Sheet Language

XSL consists of four parts:

- XSLT - a language for transforming XML documents
- XPath - a language for navigating in XML documents
- XSL-FO - a language for formatting XML documents (discontinued in 2013)
- XQuery - a language for querying XML documents

- Note : With the CSS3 Paged Media Module, W3C has delivered a new standard for document formatting. So, since 2013, CSS3 is proposed as an XSL-FO replacement.

## What is XSLT?

- XSLT stands for XSL Transformations
- XSLT is the most important part of XSL
- XSLT transforms an XML document into another XML document
- XSLT uses XPath to navigate in XML documents
- XSLT is a W3C Recommendation

## XSLT = XSL Transformations

XSLT is the most important part of XSL.

XSLT is used to transform an XML document into another XML document, or another type of document that is recognized by a browser, like HTML and XHTML. Normally XSLT does this by transforming each XML element into an (X)HTML element.

With XSLT you can add/remove elements and attributes to or from the output file. You can also rearrange and sort elements, perform tests and make decisions about which elements to hide and display, and a lot more.

A common way to describe the transformation process is to say that XSLT transforms an XML source-tree into an XML result-tree.

## XSLT Uses XPath

XSLT uses XPath to find information in an XML document. XPath is used to navigate through elements and attributes in XML documents.

If you want to study XPath first, please read our XPath Tutorial.

## How Does it Work?

In the transformation process, XSLT uses XPath to define parts of the source document that should match one or more predefined templates. When a match is found, XSLT will transform the matching part of the source document into the result document.

## XSLT Browser Support

All major browsers support XSLT and XPath.

## XSLT is a W3C Recommendation

XSLT became a W3C Recommendation 16. November 1999.


# XSLT - Transformation

Example study: How to transform XML into XHTML using XSLT?

The details of this example will be explained in the next chapter.

## Correct Style Sheet Declaration

The root element that declares the document to be an XSL style sheet is `<xsl:stylesheet>`  or  `<xsl:transform>` .

Note: `<xsl:stylesheet>`  and `<xsl:transform>` are completely synonymous and either can be used!

The correct way to declare an XSL style sheet according to the W3C XSLT Recommendation is:

```xml
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

```

or

```xml
<xsl:transform version="1.0"
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
```

To get access to the XSLT elements, attributes and features we must declare the XSLT namespace at the top of the document.

The xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" points to the official W3C XSLT namespace. If you use this namespace, you must also include the attribute version="1.0".

## Start with a Raw XML Document

We want to transform the following XML document ("cdcatalog.xml") into XHTML:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<catalog>
  <cd>
    <title>Empire Burlesque</title>
    <artist>Bob Dylan</artist>
    <country>USA</country>
    <company>Columbia</company>
    <price>10.90</price>
    <year>1985</year>
  </cd>
.
.
</catalog>

```

Viewing XML Files in browsers: Open the XML file (click on the link below) - The XML document will be displayed with color-coded root and child elements. Often, there is an arrow or plus/minus sign to the left of the elements that can be clicked to expand or collapse the element structure. Tip: To view the raw XML source, right-click in XML file and select "View Page Source"!

https://www.w3schools.com/xml/cdcatalog.xml

## Create an XSL Style Sheet

Then you create an XSL Style Sheet ("cdcatalog.xsl") with a transformation template:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

<xsl:template match="/">
  <html>
  <body>
  <h2>My CD Collection</h2>
  <table border="1">
    <tr bgcolor="#9acd32">
      <th>Title</th>
      <th>Artist</th>
    </tr>
    <xsl:for-each select="catalog/cd">
    <tr>
      <td><xsl:value-of select="title"/></td>
      <td><xsl:value-of select="artist"/></td>
    </tr>
    </xsl:for-each>
  </table>
  </body>
  </html>
</xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>

```

## Link the XSL Style Sheet to the XML Document

Add the XSL style sheet reference to your XML document ("cdcatalog.xml"):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="cdcatalog.xsl"?>
<catalog>
  <cd>
    <title>Empire Burlesque</title>
    <artist>Bob Dylan</artist>
    <country>USA</country>
    <company>Columbia</company>
    <price>10.90</price>
    <year>1985</year>
  </cd>
.
.
</catalog>

```

If you have an XSLT compliant browser it will nicely transform your XML into XHTML.

https://www.w3schools.com/xml/cdcatalog_with_xsl.xml

The details of the example above will be explained in the next chapters.

# XSLT <xsl:template> Element

An XSL style sheet consists of one or more set of rules that are called templates.

A template contains rules to apply when a specified node is matched.

## The <xsl:template> Element

The `<xsl:template>` element is used to build templates.

The match attribute is used to associate a template with an XML element. The match attribute can also be used to define a template for the entire XML document. The value of the match attribute is an XPath expression (i.e. match="/" defines the whole document).

((tr:associate:ili≈ükilendirmek))

Ok, let's look at a simplified version of the XSL file from the previous chapter:

Example

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

<xsl:template match="/">
  <html>
  <body>
  <h2>My CD Collection</h2>
  <table border="1">
    <tr bgcolor="#9acd32">
      <th>Title</th>
      <th>Artist</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>.</td>
      <td>.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </body>
  </html>
</xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>

```

**Example Explained**

Since an XSL style sheet is an XML document, it always begins with the XML declaration: `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`.

The next element, `<xsl:stylesheet>`, defines that this document is an XSLT style sheet document (along with the version number and XSLT namespace attributes).

The `<xsl:template>` element defines a template. The match="/" attribute associates the template with the root of the XML source document.

The content inside the `<xsl:template>` element defines some HTML to write to the output.

The last two lines define the end of the template and the end of the style sheet.

The result from this example was a little disappointing, because no data was copied from the XML document to the output. In the next chapter you will learn how to use the `<xsl:value-of>` element to select values from the XML elements.
