# Modules, introduction

As our application grows bigger, we want to split it into multiple files, so called "modules". A module may contain a class or a library of functions for a specific purpose.

For a long time, JavaScript existed without a language-level module syntax. That wasn't a problem, because initially scripts were small and simple, so there was no need.

But eventually scripts became more and more complex, so the community invented a variety of ways to organize code into modules, special libraries to load modules on demand.

To name some (for historical reasons):

- [AMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition) -- one of the most ancient module systems, initially implemented by the library [require.js](http://requirejs.org/).
- [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1) -- the module system created for Node.js server.
- [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) -- one more module system, suggested as a universal one, compatible with AMD and CommonJS.

Now all these slowly become a part of history, but we still can find them in old scripts.

The language-level module system appeared in the standard in **2015**, gradually evolved since then, and is now supported by all major browsers and in Node.js. So we'll study the modern JavaScript modules from now on.

## What is a module?

A module is just a file. One script is one module. As simple as that.

Modules can load each other and use special directives `export` and `import` to interchange functionality, call functions of one module from another one:

- `export` keyword labels variables and functions that should be accessible from outside the current module.
- `import` allows the import of functionality from other modules.

For instance, if we have a file `sayHi.js` exporting a function:

```js
// üìÅ sayHi.js
export function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}
```

...Then another file may import and use it:

```js
// üìÅ main.js
import {sayHi} from './sayHi.js';

alert(sayHi); // function...
sayHi('John'); // Hello, John!
```

The `import` directive loads the module by path `./sayHi.js` relative to the current file, and assigns exported function `sayHi` to the corresponding variable.

Let's run the example in-browser. [ex](https://tor-web-js-info.stackblitz.io/module1.html)

As modules support special keywords and features, we must tell the browser that a script should be treated as a module, by using the attribute `<script type="module">`.

Like this:

```html
<!doctype html>
<script type="module">
  import {sayHi} from './say.js';

  document.body.innerHTML = sayHi('John');
</script>
```

The browser automatically fetches and evaluates the imported module (and its imports if needed), and then runs the script.

**Warn: Modules work only via HTTP(s), not locally**

If you try to open a web-page locally, via `file://` protocol, 
you'll find that `import/export` directives don't work. Use a local web-server, such as [static-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/static-server#getting-started) or use the "live server" capability of your editor, such as VS Code [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to test modules.


## Core module features

What's different in modules, compared to "regular" scripts?

There are core features, valid both for browser and server-side JavaScript.

### Always "use strict"

Modules always work in strict mode. E.g. assigning to an undeclared variable will give an error.

```html run
<script type="module">
  a = 5; // error
</script>
```

### Module-level scope

Each module has its own top-level scope. In other words, top-level variables and functions from a module are not seen in other scripts (to:no global).

In the example below, two scripts are imported, and `hello.js` tries to use `user` variable declared in `user.js`. It fails, because it's a separate module (you'll see the error in the console):

```html
<!doctype html>
<script type="module" src="user.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="hello.js"></script>
```

(user.js)
```js
let user = "John";
```

(hello.js)
```js 
alert(user); // no such variable (each module has independent variables)
```

Modules should `export` what they want to be accessible from outside and `import` what they need.

- `user.js` should export the `user` variable.
- `hello.js` should import it from `user.js` module.

In other words, with modules we use import/export instead of relying on global variables.

This is the correct variant:

```html
<!doctype html>
<script type="module" src="hello.js"></script>
```

(hello.js)
```js
import {user} from './user.js';

document.body.innerHTML = user; // John
```

```js
export let user = "John";
```

In the browser, if we talk about HTML pages, independent top-level scope also exists for each `<script type="module">`.

Here are two scripts on the same page, both `type="module"`. They don't see each other's top-level variables:

```html run
<script type="module">
  // The variable is only visible in this module script
  let user = "John";
</script>

<script type="module">
  alert(user); // Error: user is not defined
</script>
```

**Info**

---

In the browser, we can make a variable window-level global by explicitly assigning it to a `window` property, e.g. `window.user = "John"`. 

Then all scripts will see it, both with `type="module"` and without it. 

That said, making such global variables is frowned upon. Please try to avoid them.

---


### A module code is evaluated only the first time when imported

If the same module is imported into multiple other modules, its code is executed only once, upon the first import. Then its exports are given to all further importers.

The one-time evaluation has important consequences, that we should be aware of. 

Let's see a couple of examples.

First, if executing a module code brings side-effects, like showing a message, then importing it multiple times will trigger it only once -- the first time:

```js
// üìÅ alert.js
alert("Module is evaluated!");
```

```js
// Import the same module from different files

// üìÅ 1.js
import `./alert.js`; // Module is evaluated!

// üìÅ 2.js
import `./alert.js`; // (shows nothing)
```

The second import shows nothing, because the module has already been evaluated.

There's a rule: top-level module code should be used for initialization, creation of module-specific internal data structures. If we need to make something callable multiple times - we should export it as a function, like we did with `sayHi` above.

Now, let's consider a deeper example.

Let's say, a module exports an object:

```js
// üìÅ admin.js
export let admin = {
  name: "John"
};
```
*Important*

If this module is imported from multiple files, the module is only evaluated the first time, `admin` object is created, and then passed to all further importers.

All importers get exactly the one and only `admin` object:

```js
// üìÅ 1.js
import {admin} from './admin.js';
admin.name = "Pete";

// üìÅ 2.js
import {admin} from './admin.js';
alert(admin.name); // Pete

// Both 1.js and 2.js reference the same admin object
// Changes made in 1.js are visible in 2.js

```

As you can see, when `1.js` changes the `name` property in the imported `admin`, then `2.js` can see the new `admin.name`.

That's exactly because the module is executed only once. Exports are generated, and then they are shared between importers, so if something changes the `admin` object, other modules will see that.

*Such behavior is actually very convenient, because it allows us to *configure* modules.*

In other words, a module can provide a generic functionality that needs a setup. E.g. authentication needs credentials. Then it can export a configuration object expecting the outer code to assign to it.

Here's the classical pattern:

1. A module exports some means of configuration, e.g. a configuration object.
2. On the first import we initialize it, write to its properties. The top-level application script may do that.
3. Further imports use the module.

For instance, the `admin.js` module may provide certain functionality (e.g. authentication), but expect the credentials to come into the `config` object from outside:

```js
// üìÅ admin.js
export let config = { };

export function sayHi() {
  alert(`Ready to serve, ${config.user}!`);
}
```

Here, `admin.js` exports the `config` object (initially empty, but may have default properties too).

Then in `init.js`, the first script of our app, we import `config` from it and set `config.user`:

```js
// üìÅ init.js
import {config} from './admin.js';
config.user = "Pete";
```

...Now the module `admin.js` is configured. 

Further importers can call it, and it correctly shows the current user:

```js
// üìÅ another.js
import {sayHi} from './admin.js';

sayHi(); // Ready to serve, *!*Pete*/!*!
```

### import.meta

The object `import.meta` contains the information about the current module.

Its content depends on the environment. In the browser, it contains the URL of the script, or a current webpage URL if inside HTML:

```html run height=0
<script type="module">
  alert(import.meta.url); // script URL
  // for an inline script - the URL of the current HTML-page
  // Output : https://javascript.info/modules-intro
</script>
```

### In a module, "this" is undefined

That's kind of a minor feature, but for completeness we should mention it.

In a module, top-level `this` is undefined.

Compare it to non-module scripts, where `this` is a global object:

```html run height=0
<script>
  alert(this); // window
</script>

<script type="module">
  alert(this); // undefined
</script>
```

## Browser-specific features

There are also several browser-specific differences of scripts with `type="module"` compared to regular ones.

You may want skip this section for now if you're reading for the first time, or if you don't use JavaScript in a browser.

### Module scripts are deferred

Module scripts are *always* deferred, same effect as `defer` attribute (described in the chapter [script-async-defer](https://javascript.info/script-async-defer), for both external and inline scripts.

In other words:
- downloading external module scripts `<script type="module" src="...">` doesn't block HTML processing, they load in parallel with other resources.
- module scripts wait until the HTML document is fully ready (even if they are tiny and load faster than HTML), and then run.
- relative order of scripts is maintained: scripts that go first in the document, execute first.

As a side-effect, module scripts always "see" the fully loaded HTML-page, including HTML elements below them.

For instance:

```html run
<script type="module">
  alert(typeof button); // object: the script can 'see' the button below
  // as modules are deferred, the script runs after the whole page is loaded
</script>

Compare to regular script below:

<script>
  alert(typeof button); // button is undefined, the script can't see elements below
  // regular scripts run immediately, before the rest of the page is processed
</script>

<button id="button">Button</button>
```

Please note: the second script actually runs before the first! So we'll see `undefined` first, and then `object`.

That's because modules are deferred, so we wait for the document to be processed. The regular script runs immediately, so we see its output first.

When using modules, we should be aware that the HTML page shows up as it loads, and JavaScript modules run after that, so the user may see the page before the JavaScript application is ready. Some functionality may not work yet. We should put "loading indicators", or otherwise ensure that the visitor won't be confused by that. 

(to:html √∂nce render edileceƒüi i√ßin bazƒ± yerler bo≈ü g√∂r√ºnebilir, kullanƒ±cƒ±nƒ±n kafasƒ± karƒ±≈ümamasƒ± i√ßin loading g√∂stergeleri eklemeliyiz.)

### Async works on inline scripts

For non-module scripts, the `async` attribute only works on external scripts. Async scripts run immediately when ready, independently of other scripts or the HTML document.

For module scripts, it works on inline scripts as well.

For example, the inline script below has `async`, so it doesn't wait for anything. `<script async ...`"

It performs the import (fetches `./analytics.js`) and runs when ready, even if the HTML document is not finished yet, or if other scripts are still pending.

That's good for functionality that doesn't depend on anything, like counters, ads, document-level event listeners.

```html
<!-- all dependencies are fetched (analytics.js), and the script runs -->
<!-- doesn't wait for the document or other <script> tags -->
<script async type="module">
  import {counter} from './analytics.js';

  counter.count();
</script>
```

### External scripts

External scripts that have `type="module"` are different in two aspects:

1. External scripts with the same `src` run only once:

```html
<!-- the script my.js is fetched and executed only once -->
<script type="module" src="my.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="my.js"></script>
```

2. External scripts that are fetched from another origin (e.g. another site) require [CORS](mdn:Web/HTTP/CORS) headers, as described in the chapter [info:fetch-crossorigin](https://javascript.info/fetch-crossorigin). In other words, if a module script is fetched from another origin, the remote server must supply a header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` allowing the fetch.

```html
<!-- another-site.com must supply Access-Control-Allow-Origin -->
<!-- otherwise, the script won't execute -->
<script type="module" src="*!*http://another-site.com/their.js*/!*"></script>
```

That ensures better security by default.

### No "bare" modules allowed (without import path)

In the browser, `import` must get either a relative or absolute URL. Modules without any path are called "bare" modules. Such modules are not allowed in `import`.

For instance, this `import` is invalid:

```js
import {sayHi} from 'sayHi'; // Error, "bare" module
// the module must have a path, e.g. './sayHi.js' or wherever the module is
```

Certain environments, like Node.js or bundle tools allow bare modules, without any path, as they have their own ways for finding modules and hooks to fine-tune them. But browsers do not support bare modules yet.

### Compatibility, "nomodule"

Old browsers do not understand `type="module"`. Scripts of an unknown type are just ignored. For them, it's possible to provide a fallback using the `nomodule` attribute:

```html run
<script type="module">
  alert("Runs in modern browsers");
</script>

<script nomodule>
  alert("Modern browsers know both type=module and nomodule, so skip this")
  alert("Old browsers ignore script with unknown type=module, but execute this.");
</script>
```

## Build tools

In real-life, browser modules are rarely used in their "raw" form. Usually, we bundle them together with a special tool such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and deploy to the production server.

One of the benefits of using bundlers -- they give more control over how modules are resolved, allowing bare modules and much more, like CSS/HTML modules.

Build tools do the following:

1. Take a "main" module, the one intended to be put in `<script type="module">` in HTML.
2. Analyze its dependencies: imports and then imports of imports etc.
3. Build a single file with all modules (or multiple files, that's tunable), replacing native `import` calls with bundler functions, so that it works. "Special" module types like HTML/CSS modules are also supported.
4. In the process, other transformations and optimizations may be applied:
    - Unreachable code removed.
    - Unused exports removed ("tree-shaking").
    - Development-specific statements like `console` and `debugger` removed.
    - Modern, bleeding-edge JavaScript syntax may be transformed to older one with similar functionality using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
    - The resulting file is minified (spaces removed, variables replaced with shorter names, etc).

If we use bundle tools, then as scripts are bundled together into a single file (or few files), `import/export` statements inside those scripts are replaced by special bundler functions. So the resulting "bundled" script does not contain any `import/export`, it doesn't require `type="module"`, and we can put it into a regular script:

```html
<!-- Assuming we got bundle.js from a tool like Webpack -->
<script src="bundle.js"></script>
```

That said, native modules are also usable. So we won't be using Webpack here: you can configure it later.

## Summary

To summarize, the core concepts are:

1. A module is a file. To make `import/export` work, browsers need `<script type="module">`. Modules have several differences:
    - Deferred by default.
    - Async works on inline scripts.
    - To load external scripts from another origin (domain/protocol/port), CORS headers are needed.
    - Duplicate external scripts are ignored.
2. Modules have their own, local top-level scope and interchange functionality via `import/export`.
3. Modules always `use strict`.
4. Module code is executed only once. Exports are created once and shared between importers.

When we use modules, each module implements the functionality and exports it. Then we use `import` to directly import it where it's needed. The browser loads and evaluates the scripts automatically.

In production, people often use bundlers such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to bundle modules together for performance and other reasons.

In the next chapter we'll see more examples of modules, and how things can be exported/imported.

# Export and Import

Export and import directives have several syntax variants.

In the previous article we saw a simple use, now let's explore more examples.

## Export before declarations

We can label any declaration as exported by placing `export` before it, be it a variable, function or a class.

For instance, here all exports are valid:

```js
// export an array
export let months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar','Apr', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'];

// export a constant
export const MODULES_BECAME_STANDARD_YEAR = 2015;

// export a class
export class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

**No semicolons after export class/function**

Please note that `export` before a class or a function does not make it a [function expression](info:function-expressions). It's still a function declaration, albeit exported.

Most JavaScript style guides don't recommend semicolons after function and class declarations.

That's why there's no need for a semicolon at the end of `export class` and `export function`:

```js
export function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
} // no ; at the end
```

## Export apart from declarations

Also, we can put `export` separately.

Here we first declare, and then export:

```js  
// üìÅ say.js
function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}

function sayBye(user) {
  alert(`Bye, ${user}!`);
}

export {sayHi, sayBye}; // a list of exported variables

```

...Or, technically we could put `export` above functions as well.

## Import *

Usually, we put a list of what to import in curly braces `import {...}`, like this:

```js
// üìÅ main.js
import {sayHi, sayBye} from './say.js';

sayHi('John'); // Hello, John!
sayBye('John'); // Bye, John!
```

But if there's a lot to import, we can import everything as *an object* using `import * as <obj>`, for instance:

```js
// üìÅ main.js
import * as say from './say.js';

say.sayHi('John');
say.sayBye('John');
```

At first sight, "import everything" seems such a cool thing, short to write, why should we ever explicitly list what we need to import?

Well, there are few reasons.

1. Modern build tools ([webpack](http://webpack.github.io) and others) bundle modules together and optimize them to speedup loading and remove unused stuff.

Let's say, we added a 3rd-party library `say.js` to our project with many functions:

```js
// üìÅ say.js
export function sayHi() { ... }
export function sayBye() { ... }
export function becomeSilent() { ... }
```

Now if we only use one of `say.js` functions in our project:
```js
// üìÅ main.js
import {sayHi} from './say.js';
```
...Then the optimizer will see that and remove the other functions from the bundled code, thus making the build smaller. That is called *"tree-shaking"*.

2. Explicitly listing what to import gives shorter names: `sayHi()` instead of `say.sayHi()`.
3. Explicit list of imports gives better overview of the code structure: what is used and where. It makes code support and refactoring easier.

## Import "as"

We can also use `as` to import under different names.

For instance, let's import `sayHi` into the local variable `hi` for brevity, and import `sayBye` as `bye`:

```js
// üìÅ main.js
import {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye} from './say.js';

hi('John'); // Hello, John!
bye('John'); // Bye, John!
```

## Export "as"

The similar syntax exists for `export`.

Let's export functions as `hi` and `bye`:

```js
// üìÅ say.js
...
export {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye};
```

Now `hi` and `bye` are official names for outsiders, to be used in imports:

```js
// üìÅ main.js
import * as say from './say.js';

say.hi('John'); // Hello, John!
say.bye('John'); // Bye, John!
```

## Export default

In practice, there are mainly two kinds of modules.

1. Modules that contain a library, pack of functions, like `say.js` above.
2. Modules that declare a single entity, e.g. a module `user.js` exports only `class User`.

Mostly, the second approach is preferred, so that every "thing" resides in its own module.

Naturally, that requires a lot of files, as everything wants its own module, but that's not a problem at all. Actually, code navigation becomes easier if files are well-named and structured into folders.

Modules provide a special `export default` ("the default export") syntax to make the "one thing per module" way look better.

Put `export default` before the entity to export:

```js
// üìÅ user.js
export default class User { // just add "default"
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

There may be only one `export default` per file.

...And then import it without *curly braces*:

```js
// üìÅ main.js
import User from './user.js'; // not {User}, just User

new User('John');
```

Imports without curly braces look nicer. A common mistake when starting to use modules is to forget curly braces at all. So, remember, `import` needs curly braces for named exports and doesn't need them for the default one.

| Named export              | Default export                    |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `export class User {...}` | `export default class User {...}` |
| `import {User} from ...`  | `import User from ...`            |

Technically, we may have both default and named exports in a single module, but in practice people usually don't mix them. A module has either named exports or the default one.

As there may be at most one default export per file, the exported entity may have no name.

For instance, these are all perfectly valid default exports:

```js
export default class { // no class name
  constructor() { ... }
}
```

```js
export default function(user) { // no function name
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}
```

```js
// export a single value, without making a variable
export default ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar','Apr', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'];
```

Not giving a name is fine, because there is only one `export default` per file, so `import` without curly braces knows what to import.

Without `default`, such an export would give an error:

```js
export class { // Error! (non-default export needs a name)
  constructor() {}
}
```     

--*LINK cont

### The "default" name (export as default separately)

In some situations the `default` keyword is used to reference the default export.

For example, to export a function separately from its definition:

```js
function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}

// same as if we added "export default" before the function
export {sayHi as default};
```

Or, another situation, let's say a module `user.js` exports one main "default" thing, and a few named ones (rarely the case, but it happens):

```js
// üìÅ user.js
export default class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

export function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}
```

Here's how to import the default export along with a named one:

```js
// üìÅ main.js
import {default as User, sayHi} from './user.js';

new User('John');
```

And, finally, if importing everything `*` as an object, then the `default` property is exactly the default export:

```js
// üìÅ main.js
import * as user from './user.js';

let User = user.default; // the default export
new User('John');
```

### A word against default exports

Named exports are explicit. They exactly name what they import, so we have that information from them; that's a good thing.

Named exports force us to use exactly the right name to import:

```js
import {User} from './user.js';
// import {MyUser} won't work, the name must be {User}
```

...While for a default export, we always choose the name when importing:

```js
import User from './user.js'; // works
import MyUser from './user.js'; // works too
// could be import Anything... and it'll still work
```

So team members may use different names to import the same thing, and that's not good.

Usually, to avoid that and keep the code consistent, there's a rule that imported variables should correspond to file names, e.g:

```js
import User from './user.js';
import LoginForm from './loginForm.js';
import func from '/path/to/func.js';
...
```

Still, some teams consider it a serious drawback of default exports. So they prefer to always use named exports. Even if only a single thing is exported, it's still exported under a name, without `default`.

That also makes re-export (see below) a little bit easier.

## Re-export and (export ... from) syntax

"Re-export" syntax `export ... from ...` allows to import things and immediately export them (possibly under another name), like this:

```js
export {sayHi} from './say.js'; // re-export sayHi

export {default as User} from './user.js'; // re-export default
```

Why would that be needed? Let's see a practical use case.

Imagine, we're writing a "package": a folder with a lot of modules, with some of the functionality exported outside (tools like NPM allow us to publish and distribute such packages, but we don't have to use them), and many modules are just "helpers", for internal use in other package modules.

The file structure could be like this:
```
auth/
    index.js  
    user.js
    helpers.js
    tests/
        login.js
    providers/
        github.js
        facebook.js
        ...
```

We'd like to expose the package functionality via a single entry point.

In other words, a person who would like to use our package, should import only from the "main file" `auth/index.js`.

Like this:

```js
import {login, logout} from 'auth/index.js'
```

The "main file", `auth/index.js` exports all the functionality that we'd like to provide in our package.

The idea is that outsiders, other programmers who use our package, should not meddle with its internal structure, search for files inside our package folder. We export only what's necessary in `auth/index.js` and keep the rest hidden from prying eyes.

As the actual exported functionality is scattered among the package, we can import it into `auth/index.js` and export from it:

```js
// üìÅ auth/index.js

// import login/logout and immediately export them
import {login, logout} from './helpers.js';
export {login, logout};

// import default as User and export it
import User from './user.js';
export {User};
...
```

Now users of our package can `import {login} from "auth/index.js"`.

The syntax `export ... from ...` is just a shorter notation for such import-export:

```js
// üìÅ auth/index.js
// re-export login/logout 
export {login, logout} from './helpers.js';

// re-export the default export as User
export {default as User} from './user.js';
...
```

The notable difference of `export ... from` compared to `import/export` is that re-exported modules aren't available in the current file. So inside the above example of `auth/index.js` we can't use re-exported `login/logout` functions. 

### Re-exporting the default export

The default export needs separate handling when re-exporting.

Let's say we have `user.js` with the `export default class User` and would like to re-export it:

```js
// üìÅ user.js
export default class User {
  // ...
}
```

We can come across two problems with it:

1. `export User from './user.js'` won't work. That would lead to a syntax error.

  To re-export the default export, we have to write `export {default as User}`, as in the example above.    

2. `export * from './user.js'` re-exports only named exports, but ignores the default one.

  If we'd like to re-export both named and the default export, then two statements are needed:
  ```js
  export * from './user.js'; // to re-export named exports
  export {default} from './user.js'; // to re-export the default export
  ```

Such oddities of re-exporting a default export are one of the reasons why some developers don't like default exports and prefer named ones.

## Summary

Here are all types of `export` that we covered in this and previous articles.

You can check yourself by reading them and recalling what they mean:

- Before declaration of a class/function/..:
  - `export [default] class/function/variable ...`
- Standalone export:
  - `export {x [as y], ...}`.
- Re-export:
  - `export {x [as y], ...} from "module"`
  - `export * from "module"` (doesn't re-export default).
  - `export {default [as y]} from "module"` (re-export default).

Import:

- Importing named exports:
  - `import {x [as y], ...} from "module"`
- Importing the default export:  
  - `import x from "module"`
  - `import {default as x} from "module"`
- Import all:
  - `import * as obj from "module"`
- Import the module (its code runs), but do not assign any of its exports to variables:
  - `import "module"`

We can put `import/export` statements at the top or at the bottom of a script, that doesn't matter.

So, technically this code is fine:
```js
sayHi();

// ...

import {sayHi} from './say.js'; // import at the end of the file
```

In practice imports are usually at the start of the file, but that's only for more convenience.

**Please note that import/export statements don't work if inside `{...}`.**

A conditional import, like this, won't work:
```js
if (something) {
  import {sayHi} from "./say.js"; // Error: import must be at top level
}
```

...But what if we really need to import something conditionally? Or at the right time? Like, load a module upon request, when it's really needed?

We'll see dynamic imports in the next article.

# Dynamic imports

Export and import statements that we covered in previous chapters are called "static". The syntax is very simple and strict.

First, we can't dynamically generate any parameters of `import`.

The module path must be a primitive string, can't be a function call. This won't work:

```js
import ... from getModuleName(); // Error, only from "string" is allowed
```

Second, we can't import conditionally or at run-time:

```js
if(...) {
  import ...; // Error, not allowed!
}

{
  import ...; // Error, we can't put import in any block
}
```

That's because `import`/`export` aim to provide a backbone for the code structure. That's a good thing, as code structure can be analyzed, modules can be gathered and bundled into one file by special tools, unused exports can be removed ("tree-shaken"). That's possible only because the structure of imports/exports is simple and fixed.

But how can we import a module dynamically, on-demand?

## The import() expression

The `import(module)` expression loads the module and returns a promise that resolves into a module object that contains all its exports. It can be called from any place in the code.

We can use it dynamically in any place of the code, for instance:

```js
let modulePath = prompt("Which module to load?");

import(modulePath)
  .then(obj => <module object>)
  .catch(err => <loading error, e.g. if no such module>)
```

Or, we could use `let module = await import(modulePath)` if inside an async function.

For instance, if we have the following module `say.js`:

```js
// üìÅ say.js
export function hi() {
  alert(`Hello`);
}

export function bye() {
  alert(`Bye`);
}
```

...Then dynamic import can be like this:

```js
let {hi, bye} = await import('./say.js');

hi();
bye();
```

Or, if `say.js` has the default export:

```js
// üìÅ say.js
export default function() {
  alert("Module loaded (export default)!");
}
```

...Then, in order to access it, we can use `default` property of the module object:

```js
let obj = await import('./say.js');
let say = obj.default;
// or, in one line: let {default: say} = await import('./say.js');

say();
```

Here's the full example:

[codetabs src="say" current="index.html"]

```html
<!doctype html>
<script>
  async function load() {
    let say = await import('./say.js');
    say.hi(); // Hello!
    say.bye(); // Bye!
    say.default(); // Module loaded (export default)!
  }
</script>
<button onclick="load()">Click me</button>
```

```js
// say.js
export function hi() {
  alert(`Hello`);
}

export function bye() {
  alert(`Bye`);
}

export default function() {
  alert("Module loaded (export default)!");
}
```

**Note**

Dynamic imports work in regular scripts, they don't require `script type="module"`.

---

**Note**

Although `import()` looks like a function call, it's a special syntax that just happens to use parentheses (similar to `super()`).

So we can't copy `import` to a variable or use `call/apply` with it. It's not a function.
