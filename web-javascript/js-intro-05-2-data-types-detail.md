# WeakMap and WeakSet

As we know from the chapter <info:garbage-collection>, JavaScript engine keeps a value in memory while it is "reachable" and can potentially be used.

For instance:
```js
let john = { name: "John" };

// the object can be accessed, john is the reference to it

// overwrite the reference
john = null;

*!*
// the object will be removed from memory
*/!*
```

Usually, properties of an object or elements of an array or another data structure are considered reachable and kept in memory while that data structure is in memory.

For instance, if we put an object into an array, then while the array is alive, the object will be alive as well, even if there are no other references to it.

Like this:

```js
let john = { name: "John" };

let array = [ john ];

john = null; // overwrite the reference

*!*
// the object previously referenced by john is stored inside the array
// therefore it won't be garbage-collected
// we can get it as array[0]
*/!*
```

Similar to that, if we use an object as the key in a regular `Map`, then while the `Map` exists, that object exists as well. It occupies memory and may not be garbage collected.

For instance:

```js
let john = { name: "John" };

let map = new Map();
map.set(john, "...");

john = null; // overwrite the reference

*!*
// john is stored inside the map,
// we can get it by using map.keys()
*/!*
```

`WeakMap` is fundamentally different in this aspect. It doesn't prevent garbage-collection of key objects.

Let's see what it means on examples.

## WeakMap

The first difference between `Map` and `WeakMap` is that keys must be objects, not primitive values:

```js run
let weakMap = new WeakMap();

let obj = {};

weakMap.set(obj, "ok"); // works fine (object key)

*!*
// can't use a string as the key
weakMap.set("test", "Whoops"); // Error, because "test" is not an object
*/!*
```

Now, if we use an object as the key in it, and there are no other references to that object -- it will be removed from memory (and from the map) automatically.

```js
let john = { name: "John" };

let weakMap = new WeakMap();
weakMap.set(john, "...");

john = null; // overwrite the reference

// john is removed from memory!
```

Compare it with the regular `Map` example above. Now if `john` only exists as the key of `WeakMap` -- it will be automatically deleted from the map (and memory).

`WeakMap` does not support iteration and methods `keys()`, `values()`, `entries()`, so there's no way to get all keys or values from it.

`WeakMap` has only the following methods:

- `weakMap.get(key)`
- `weakMap.set(key, value)`
- `weakMap.delete(key)`
- `weakMap.has(key)`

Why such a limitation? That's for technical reasons. If an object has lost all other references (like `john` in the code above), then it is to be garbage-collected automatically. But technically it's not exactly specified *when the cleanup happens*.

The JavaScript engine decides that. It may choose to perform the memory cleanup immediately or to wait and do the cleaning later when more deletions happen. So, technically, the current element count of a `WeakMap` is not known. The engine may have cleaned it up or not, or did it partially. For that reason, methods that access all keys/values are not supported.

Now, where do we need such a data structure?

## Use case: additional data

The main area of application for `WeakMap` is an *additional data storage*.

If we're working with an object that "belongs" to another code, maybe even a third-party library, and would like to store some data associated with it, that should only exist while the object is alive - then `WeakMap` is exactly what's needed.

We put the data to a `WeakMap`, using the object as the key, and when the object is garbage collected, that data will automatically disappear as well.

```js
weakMap.set(john, "secret documents");
// if john dies, secret documents will be destroyed automatically
```

Let's look at an example.

For instance, we have code that keeps a visit count for users. The information is stored in a map: a user object is the key and the visit count is the value. When a user leaves (its object gets garbage collected), we don't want to store their visit count anymore.

Here's an example of a counting function with `Map`:

```js
// üìÅ visitsCount.js
let visitsCountMap = new Map(); // map: user => visits count

// increase the visits count
function countUser(user) {
  let count = visitsCountMap.get(user) || 0;
  visitsCountMap.set(user, count + 1);
}
```

And here's another part of the code, maybe another file using it:

```js
// üìÅ main.js
let john = { name: "John" };

countUser(john); // count his visits

// later john leaves us
john = null;
```

Now, `john` object should be garbage collected, but remains in memory, as it's a key in `visitsCountMap`.

We need to clean `visitsCountMap` when we remove users, otherwise it will grow in memory indefinitely. Such cleaning can become a tedious task in complex architectures.

We can avoid it by switching to `WeakMap` instead:

```js
// üìÅ visitsCount.js
let visitsCountMap = new WeakMap(); // weakmap: user => visits count

// increase the visits count
function countUser(user) {
  let count = visitsCountMap.get(user) || 0;
  visitsCountMap.set(user, count + 1);
}
```

Now we don't have to clean `visitsCountMap`. After `john` object becomes unreachable, by all means except as a key of `WeakMap`, it gets removed from memory, along with the information by that key from `WeakMap`.

## Use case: caching

Another common example is caching. We can store ("cache") results from a function, so that future calls on the same object can reuse it.

To achieve that, we can use `Map` (not optimal scenario):

```js run
// üìÅ cache.js
let cache = new Map();

// calculate and remember the result
function process(obj) {
  if (!cache.has(obj)) {
    let result = /* calculations of the result for */ obj;

    cache.set(obj, result);
  }

  return cache.get(obj);
}

*!*
// Now we use process() in another file:
*/!*

// üìÅ main.js
let obj = {/* let's say we have an object */};

let result1 = process(obj); // calculated

// ...later, from another place of the code...
let result2 = process(obj); // remembered result taken from cache

// ...later, when the object is not needed any more:
obj = null;

alert(cache.size); // 1 (Ouch! The object is still in cache, taking memory!)
```

For multiple calls of `process(obj)` with the same object, it only calculates the result the first time, and then just takes it from `cache`. The downside is that we need to clean `cache` when the object is not needed any more.

If we replace `Map` with `WeakMap`, then this problem disappears. The cached result will be removed from memory automatically after the object gets garbage collected.

```js run
// üìÅ cache.js
*!*
let cache = new WeakMap();
*/!*

// calculate and remember the result
function process(obj) {
  if (!cache.has(obj)) {
    let result = /* calculate the result for */ obj;

    cache.set(obj, result);
  }

  return cache.get(obj);
}

// üìÅ main.js
let obj = {/* some object */};

let result1 = process(obj);
let result2 = process(obj);

// ...later, when the object is not needed any more:
obj = null;

// Can't get cache.size, as it's a WeakMap,
// but it's 0 or soon be 0
// When obj gets garbage collected, cached data will be removed as well
```

## WeakSet

`WeakSet` behaves similarly:

- It is analogous to `Set`, but we may only add objects to `WeakSet` (not primitives).
- An object exists in the set while it is reachable from somewhere else.
- Like `Set`, it supports `add`, `has` and `delete`, but not `size`, `keys()` and no iterations.

Being "weak", it also serves as additional storage. But not for arbitrary data, rather for "yes/no" facts. A membership in `WeakSet` may mean something about the object.

For instance, we can add users to `WeakSet` to keep track of those who visited our site:

```js run
let visitedSet = new WeakSet();

let john = { name: "John" };
let pete = { name: "Pete" };
let mary = { name: "Mary" };

visitedSet.add(john); // John visited us
visitedSet.add(pete); // Then Pete
visitedSet.add(john); // John again

// visitedSet has 2 users now

// check if John visited?
alert(visitedSet.has(john)); // true

// check if Mary visited?
alert(visitedSet.has(mary)); // false

john = null;

// visitedSet will be cleaned automatically
```

The most notable limitation of `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` is the absence of iterations, and the inability to get all current content. That may appear inconvenient, but does not prevent `WeakMap/WeakSet` from doing their main job -- be an "additional" storage of data for objects which are stored/managed at another place.

## Summary

`WeakMap` is `Map`-like collection that allows only objects as keys and removes them together with associated value once they become inaccessible by other means.

`WeakSet` is `Set`-like collection that stores only objects and removes them once they become inaccessible by other means.

Their main advantages are that they have weak reference to objects, so they can easily be removed by garbage collector.

That comes at the cost of not having support for `clear`, `size`, `keys`, `values`...

`WeakMap` and `WeakSet` are used as "secondary" data structures in addition to the "primary" object storage. Once the object is removed from the primary storage, if it is only found as the key of `WeakMap` or in a `WeakSet`, it will be cleaned up automatically.



# Object.keys, values, entries

Let's step away from the individual data structures and talk about the iterations over them.

In the previous chapter we saw methods `map.keys()`, `map.values()`, `map.entries()`.

These methods are generic, there is a common agreement to use them for data structures. If we ever create a data structure of our own, we should implement them too.

They are supported for:

- `Map`
- `Set`
- `Array`

Plain objects also support similar methods, but the syntax is a bit different.

## Object.keys, values, entries

For plain objects, the following methods are available:

- [Object.keys(obj)](mdn:js/Object/keys) -- returns an array of keys.
- [Object.values(obj)](mdn:js/Object/values) -- returns an array of values.
- [Object.entries(obj)](mdn:js/Object/entries) -- returns an array of `[key, value]` pairs.

Please note the distinctions (compared to map for example):

|             | Map          | Object                                   |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| Call syntax | `map.keys()` | `Object.keys(obj)`, but not `obj.keys()` |
| Returns     | iterable     | "real" Array                             |

The first difference is that we have to call `Object.keys(obj)`, and not `obj.keys()`.

Why so? The main reason is flexibility. Remember, objects are a base of all complex structures in JavaScript. So we may have an object of our own like `data` that implements its own `data.values()` method. And we still can call `Object.values(data)` on it.

The second difference is that `Object.*` methods return "real" array objects, not just an iterable. That's mainly for historical reasons.

For instance:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};
```

- `Object.keys(user) = ["name", "age"]`
- `Object.values(user) = ["John", 30]`
- `Object.entries(user) = [ ["name","John"], ["age",30] ]`

Here's an example of using `Object.values` to loop over property values:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

// loop over values
for (let value of Object.values(user)) {
  alert(value); // John, then 30
}
```

```warn header="Object.keys/values/entries ignore symbolic properties"
Just like a `for..in` loop, these methods ignore properties that use `Symbol(...)` as keys.

Usually that's convenient. But if we want symbolic keys too, then there's a separate method [Object.getOwnPropertySymbols](mdn:js/Object/getOwnPropertySymbols) that returns an array of only symbolic keys. Also, there exist a method [Reflect.ownKeys(obj)](mdn:js/Reflect/ownKeys) that returns *all* keys.
```


## Transforming objects

Objects lack many methods that exist for arrays, e.g. `map`, `filter` and others.

If we'd like to apply them, then we can use `Object.entries` followed by `Object.fromEntries`:

1. Use `Object.entries(obj)` to get an array of key/value pairs from `obj`.
2. Use array methods on that array, e.g. `map`, to transform these key/value pairs.
3. Use `Object.fromEntries(array)` on the resulting array to turn it back into an object.

For example, we have an object with prices, and would like to double them:

```js run
let prices = {
  banana: 1,
  orange: 2,
  meat: 4,
};

*!*
let doublePrices = Object.fromEntries(
  // convert prices to array, map each key/value pair into another pair
  // and then fromEntries gives back the object
  Object.entries(prices).map(entry => [entry[0], entry[1] * 2])
);
*/!*

alert(doublePrices.meat); // 8
```

It may look difficult at first sight, but becomes easy to understand after you use it once or twice. We can make powerful chains of transforms this way.

# Destructuring assignment

The two most used data structures in JavaScript are `Object` and `Array`.

- Objects allow us to create a single entity that stores data items by key. 
- Arrays allow us to gather data items into an ordered list.

Although, when we pass those to a function, it may need not an object/array as a whole. It may need individual pieces.

*Destructuring assignment* is a special syntax that allows us to "unpack" arrays or objects into a bunch of variables, as sometimes that's more convenient. 

Destructuring also works great with complex functions that have a lot of parameters, default values, and so on. Soon we'll see that.

## Array destructuring

Here's an example of how an array is destructured into variables:

```js
// we have an array with the name and surname
let arr = ["John", "Smith"]

*!*
// destructuring assignment
// sets firstName = arr[0]
// and surname = arr[1]
let [firstName, surname] = arr;
*/!*

alert(firstName); // John
alert(surname);  // Smith
```

Now we can work with variables instead of array members.

It looks great when combined with `split` or other array-returning methods:

```js run
let [firstName, surname] = "John Smith".split(' ');
alert(firstName); // John
alert(surname);  // Smith
```

As you can see, the syntax is simple. There are several peculiar details though. Let's see more examples, to better understand it.

%%smart header="\"Destructuring\" does not mean \"destructive\"."
It's called "destructuring assignment," because it "destructurizes" by copying items into variables. But the array itself is not modified.

It's just a shorter way to write:
```js
// let [firstName, surname] = arr;
let firstName = arr[0];
let surname = arr[1];
```
%%

%%smart header="Ignore elements using commas"
Unwanted elements of the array can also be thrown away via an extra comma:

```js run
*!*
// second element is not needed
let [firstName, , title] = ["Julius", "Caesar", "Consul", "of the Roman Republic"];
*/!*

alert( title ); // Consul
```

In the code above, the second element of the array is skipped, the third one is assigned to `title`, and the rest of the array items is also skipped (as there are no variables for them).
%%

%%smart header="Works with any iterable on the right-side"

...Actually, we can use it with any iterable, not only arrays:

```js
let [a, b, c] = "abc"; // ["a", "b", "c"]
let [one, two, three] = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
```
That works, because internally a destructuring assignment works by iterating over the right value. It's kind of syntax sugar for calling `for..of` over the value to the right of `=` and assigning the values.
%%


%%smart header="Assign to anything at the left-side"
We can use any "assignables" at the left side.

For instance, an object property:
```js run
let user = {};
[user.name, user.surname] = "John Smith".split(' ');

alert(user.name); // John
alert(user.surname); // Smith
```

%%

%%smart header="Looping with .entries()"
In the previous chapter we saw the [Object.entries(obj)](mdn:js/Object/entries) method.

We can use it with destructuring to loop over keys-and-values of an object:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

// loop over keys-and-values
*!*
for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(user)) {
*/!*
  alert(`${key}:${value}`); // name:John, then age:30
}
```

The similar code for a `Map` is simpler, as it's iterable:

```js run
let user = new Map();
user.set("name", "John");
user.set("age", "30");

*!*
// Map iterates as [key, value] pairs, very convenient for destructuring
for (let [key, value] of user) {
*/!*
  alert(`${key}:${value}`); // name:John, then age:30
}
```
%%

%%smart header="Swap variables trick"
There's a well-known trick for swapping values of two variables using a destructuring assignment:

```js run
let guest = "Jane";
let admin = "Pete";

// Let's swap the values: make guest=Pete, admin=Jane
*!*
[guest, admin] = [admin, guest];
*/!*

alert(`${guest} ${admin}`); // Pete Jane (successfully swapped!)
```

Here we create a temporary array of two variables and immediately destructure it in swapped order.

We can swap more than two variables this way.
%%

### The rest '...'

Usually, if the array is longer than the list at the left, the "extra" items are omitted.

For example, here only two items are taken, and the rest is just ignored:

```js run
let [name1, name2] = ["Julius", "Caesar", "Consul", "of the Roman Republic"];

alert(name1); // Julius
alert(name2); // Caesar
// Further items aren't assigned anywhere
```

If we'd like also to gather all that follows -- we can add one more parameter that gets "the rest" using three dots `"..."`:

```js run
let [name1, name2, *!*...rest*/!*] = ["Julius", "Caesar", *!*"Consul", "of the Roman Republic"*/!*];

*!*
// rest is array of items, starting from the 3rd one
alert(rest[0]); // Consul
alert(rest[1]); // of the Roman Republic
alert(rest.length); // 2
*/!*
```

The value of `rest` is the array of the remaining array elements. 

We can use any other variable name in place of `rest`, just make sure it has three dots before it and goes last in the destructuring assignment.

```js run
let [name1, name2, *!*...titles*/!*] = ["Julius", "Caesar", "Consul", "of the Roman Republic"];
// now titles = ["Consul", "of the Roman Republic"]
```

### Default values

If the array is shorter than the list of variables at the left, there'll be no errors. Absent values are considered undefined:

```js run
*!*
let [firstName, surname] = [];
*/!*

alert(firstName); // undefined
alert(surname); // undefined
```

If we want a "default" value to replace the missing one, we can provide it using `=`:

```js run
*!*
// default values
let [name = "Guest", surname = "Anonymous"] = ["Julius"];
*/!*

alert(name);    // Julius (from array)
alert(surname); // Anonymous (default used)
```

Default values can be more complex expressions or even function calls. They are evaluated only if the value is not provided.

For instance, here we use the `prompt` function for two defaults:

```js run
// runs only prompt for surname
let [name = prompt('name?'), surname = prompt('surname?')] = ["Julius"];

alert(name);    // Julius (from array)
alert(surname); // whatever prompt gets
```

Please note: the `prompt` will run only for the missing value (`surname`).

## Object destructuring

The destructuring assignment also works with objects.

The basic syntax is:

```js
let {var1, var2} = {var1:‚Ä¶, var2:‚Ä¶}
```

We should have an existing object at the right side, that we want to split into variables. The left side contains an object-like "pattern" for corresponding properties. In the simplest case, that's a list of variable names in `{...}`.

For instance:

```js run
let options = {
  title: "Menu",
  width: 100,
  height: 200
};

*!*
let {title, width, height} = options;
*/!*

alert(title);  // Menu
alert(width);  // 100
alert(height); // 200
```

Properties `options.title`, `options.width` and `options.height` are assigned to the corresponding variables. 

The order does not matter. This works too:

```js
// changed the order in let {...}
let {height, width, title} = { title: "Menu", height: 200, width: 100 }
```

The pattern on the left side may be more complex and specify the mapping between properties and variables.

If we want to assign a property to a variable with another name, for instance, make `options.width` go into the variable named `w`, then we can set the variable name using a colon:

```js run
let options = {
  title: "Menu",
  width: 100,
  height: 200
};

*!*
// { sourceProperty: targetVariable }
let {width: w, height: h, title} = options;
*/!*

// width -> w
// height -> h
// title -> title

alert(title);  // Menu
alert(w);      // 100
alert(h);      // 200
```

The colon shows "what : goes where". In the example above the property `width` goes to `w`, property `height` goes to `h`, and `title` is assigned to the same name.

For potentially missing properties we can set default values using `"="`, like this:

```js run
let options = {
  title: "Menu"
};

*!*
let {width = 100, height = 200, title} = options;
*/!*

alert(title);  // Menu
alert(width);  // 100
alert(height); // 200
```

Just like with arrays or function parameters, default values can be any expressions or even function calls. They will be evaluated if the value is not provided.

In the code below `prompt` asks for `width`, but not for `title`:

```js run
let options = {
  title: "Menu"
};

*!*
let {width = prompt("width?"), title = prompt("title?")} = options;
*/!*

alert(title);  // Menu
alert(width);  // (whatever the result of prompt is)
```

We also can combine both the colon and equality:

```js run
let options = {
  title: "Menu"
};

*!*
let {width: w = 100, height: h = 200, title} = options;
*/!*

alert(title);  // Menu
alert(w);      // 100
alert(h);      // 200
```

If we have a complex object with many properties, we can extract only what we need:

```js run
let options = {
  title: "Menu",
  width: 100,
  height: 200
};

// only extract title as a variable
let { title } = options;

alert(title); // Menu
```

### The rest pattern "..."

What if the object has more properties than we have variables? Can we take some and then assign the "rest" somewhere?

We can use the rest pattern, just like we did with arrays. It's not supported by some older browsers (IE, use Babel to polyfill it), but works in modern ones.

It looks like this:

```js run
let options = {
  title: "Menu",
  height: 200,
  width: 100
};

*!*
// title = property named title
// rest = object with the rest of properties
let {title, ...rest} = options;
*/!*

// now title="Menu", rest={height: 200, width: 100}
alert(rest.height);  // 200
alert(rest.width);   // 100
```

%%smart header="Gotcha if there's no `let`"
In the examples above variables were declared right in the assignment: `let {‚Ä¶} = {‚Ä¶}`. Of course, we could use existing variables too, without `let`. But there's a catch.

This won't work:
```js run
let title, width, height;

// error in this line
{title, width, height} = {title: "Menu", width: 200, height: 100};
```

The problem is that JavaScript treats `{...}` in the main code flow (not inside another expression) as a code block. Such code blocks can be used to group statements, like this:

```js run
{
  // a code block
  let message = "Hello";
  // ...
  alert( message );
}
```

So here JavaScript assumes that we have a code block, that's why there's an error. We want destructuring instead.

To show JavaScript that it's not a code block, we can wrap the expression in parentheses `(...)`:

```js run
let title, width, height;

// okay now
*!*(*/!*{title, width, height} = {title: "Menu", width: 200, height: 100}*!*)*/!*;

alert( title ); // Menu
```
%%

## Nested destructuring

If an object or an array contain other nested objects and arrays, we can use more complex left-side patterns to extract deeper portions.

In the code below `options` has another object in the property `size` and an array in the property `items`. The pattern at the left side of the assignment has the same structure to extract values from them:

```js run
let options = {
  size: {
    width: 100,
    height: 200
  },
  items: ["Cake", "Donut"],
  extra: true   
};

// destructuring assignment split in multiple lines for clarity
let {
  size: { // put size here
    width,
    height
  },
  items: [item1, item2], // assign items here
  title = "Menu" // not present in the object (default value is used)
} = options;

alert(title);  // Menu
alert(width);  // 100
alert(height); // 200
alert(item1);  // Cake
alert(item2);  // Donut
```

All properties of `options` object except `extra` that is absent in the left part, are assigned to corresponding variables:

![](destructuring-complex.svg)

Finally, we have `width`, `height`, `item1`, `item2` and `title` from the default value.

Note that there are no variables for `size` and `items`, as we take their content instead.

## Smart function parameters

There are times when a function has many parameters, most of which are optional. That's especially true for user interfaces. Imagine a function that creates a menu. It may have a width, a height, a title, items list and so on.

Here's a bad way to write such function:

```js
function showMenu(title = "Untitled", width = 200, height = 100, items = []) {
  // ...
}
```

In real-life, the problem is how to remember the order of arguments. Usually IDEs try to help us, especially if the code is well-documented, but still... Another problem is how to call a function when most parameters are ok by default.

Like this?

```js
// undefined where default values are fine
showMenu("My Menu", undefined, undefined, ["Item1", "Item2"])
```

That's ugly. And becomes unreadable when we deal with more parameters.

Destructuring comes to the rescue!

We can pass parameters as an object, and the function immediately destructurizes them into variables:

```js run
// we pass object to function
let options = {
  title: "My menu",
  items: ["Item1", "Item2"]
};

// ...and it immediately expands it to variables
function showMenu(*!*{title = "Untitled", width = 200, height = 100, items = []}*/!*) {
  // title, items ‚Äì taken from options,
  // width, height ‚Äì defaults used
  alert( `${title} ${width} ${height}` ); // My Menu 200 100
  alert( items ); // Item1, Item2
}

showMenu(options);
```

We can also use more complex destructuring with nested objects and colon mappings:

```js run
let options = {
  title: "My menu",
  items: ["Item1", "Item2"]
};

*!*
function showMenu({
  title = "Untitled",
  width: w = 100,  // width goes to w
  height: h = 200, // height goes to h
  items: [item1, item2] // items first element goes to item1, second to item2
}) {
*/!*
  alert( `${title} ${w} ${h}` ); // My Menu 100 200
  alert( item1 ); // Item1
  alert( item2 ); // Item2
}

showMenu(options);
```

The full syntax is the same as for a destructuring assignment:
```js
function({
  incomingProperty: varName = defaultValue
  ...
})
```

Then, for an object of parameters, there will be a variable `varName` for property `incomingProperty`, with `defaultValue` by default.

Please note that such destructuring assumes that `showMenu()` does have an argument. If we want all values by default, then we should specify an empty object:

```js
showMenu({}); // ok, all values are default

showMenu(); // this would give an error
```

We can fix this by making `{}` the default value for the whole object of parameters:

```js run
function showMenu({ title = "Menu", width = 100, height = 200 }*!* = {}*/!*) {
  alert( `${title} ${width} ${height}` );
}

showMenu(); // Menu 100 200
```

In the code above, the whole arguments object is `{}` by default, so there's always something to destructurize.

## Summary

- Destructuring assignment allows for instantly mapping an object or array onto many variables.
- The full object syntax:
    ```js
    let {prop : varName = default, ...rest} = object
    ```

    This means that property `prop` should go into the variable `varName` and, if no such property exists, then the `default` value should be used.

    Object properties that have no mapping are copied to the `rest` object.

- The full array syntax:

    ```js
    let [item1 = default, item2, ...rest] = array
    ```

    The first item goes to `item1`; the second goes into `item2`, all the rest makes the array `rest`.

- It's possible to extract data from nested arrays/objects, for that the left side must have the same structure as the right one.

# Date and time

Let's meet a new built-in object: [Date](mdn:js/Date). It stores the date, time and provides methods for date/time management.

For instance, we can use it to store creation/modification times, to measure time, or just to print out the current date.

## Creation

To create a new `Date` object call `new Date()` with one of the following arguments:

`new Date()`
: Without arguments -- create a `Date` object for the current date and time:

    ```js run
    let now = new Date();
    alert( now ); // shows current date/time
    ```

`new Date(milliseconds)`
: Create a `Date` object with the time equal to number of milliseconds (1/1000 of a second) passed after the Jan 1st of 1970 UTC+0.

    ```js run
    // 0 means 01.01.1970 UTC+0
    let Jan01_1970 = new Date(0);
    alert( Jan01_1970 );

    // now add 24 hours, get 02.01.1970 UTC+0
    let Jan02_1970 = new Date(24 * 3600 * 1000);
    alert( Jan02_1970 );
    ```

    An integer number representing the number of milliseconds that has passed since the beginning of 1970 is called a *timestamp*.

    It's a lightweight numeric representation of a date. We can always create a date from a timestamp using `new Date(timestamp)` and convert the existing `Date` object to a timestamp using the `date.getTime()` method (see below).

    Dates before 01.01.1970 have negative timestamps, e.g.:
    ```js run
    // 31 Dec 1969
    let Dec31_1969 = new Date(-24 * 3600 * 1000);
    alert( Dec31_1969 );
    ```

`new Date(datestring)`
: If there is a single argument, and it's a string, then it is parsed automatically. The algorithm is the same as `Date.parse` uses, we'll cover it later.

    ```js run
    let date = new Date("2017-01-26");
    alert(date);
    // The time is not set, so it's assumed to be midnight GMT and
    // is adjusted according to the timezone the code is run in
    // So the result could be
    // Thu Jan 26 2017 11:00:00 GMT+1100 (Australian Eastern Daylight Time)
    // or
    // Wed Jan 25 2017 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)
    ```

`new Date(year, month, date, hours, minutes, seconds, ms)`
: Create the date with the given components in the local time zone. Only the first two arguments are obligatory.

    - The `year` must have 4 digits: `2013` is okay, `98` is not.
    - The `month` count starts with `0` (Jan), up to `11` (Dec).
    - The `date` parameter is actually the day of month, if absent then `1` is assumed.
    - If `hours/minutes/seconds/ms` is absent, they are assumed to be equal `0`.

    For instance:

    ```js
    new Date(2011, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0); // 1 Jan 2011, 00:00:00
    new Date(2011, 0, 1); // the same, hours etc are 0 by default
    ```

    The maximal precision is 1 ms (1/1000 sec):

    ```js run
    let date = new Date(2011, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 567);
    alert( date ); // 1.01.2011, 02:03:04.567
    ```

## Access date components

There are methods to access the year, month and so on from the `Date` object:

[getFullYear()](mdn:js/Date/getFullYear)
: Get the year (4 digits)

[getMonth()](mdn:js/Date/getMonth)
: Get the month, **from 0 to 11**.

[getDate()](mdn:js/Date/getDate)
: Get the day of month, from 1 to 31, the name of the method does look a little bit strange.

[getHours()](mdn:js/Date/getHours), [getMinutes()](mdn:js/Date/getMinutes), [getSeconds()](mdn:js/Date/getSeconds), [getMilliseconds()](mdn:js/Date/getMilliseconds)
: Get the corresponding time components.

```warn header="Not `getYear()`, but `getFullYear()`"
Many JavaScript engines implement a non-standard method `getYear()`. This method is deprecated. It returns 2-digit year sometimes. Please never use it. There is `getFullYear()` for the year.
```

Additionally, we can get a day of week:

[getDay()](mdn:js/Date/getDay)
: Get the day of week, from `0` (Sunday) to `6` (Saturday). The first day is always Sunday, in some countries that's not so, but can't be changed.

**All the methods above return the components relative to the local time zone.**

There are also their UTC-counterparts, that return day, month, year and so on for the time zone UTC+0: [getUTCFullYear()](mdn:js/Date/getUTCFullYear), [getUTCMonth()](mdn:js/Date/getUTCMonth), [getUTCDay()](mdn:js/Date/getUTCDay). Just insert the `"UTC"` right after `"get"`.

If your local time zone is shifted relative to UTC, then the code below shows different hours:

```js run
// current date
let date = new Date();

// the hour in your current time zone
alert( date.getHours() );

// the hour in UTC+0 time zone (London time without daylight savings)
alert( date.getUTCHours() );
```

Besides the given methods, there are two special ones that do not have a UTC-variant:

[getTime()](mdn:js/Date/getTime)
: Returns the timestamp for the date -- a number of milliseconds passed from the January 1st of 1970 UTC+0.

[getTimezoneOffset()](mdn:js/Date/getTimezoneOffset)
: Returns the difference between UTC and the local time zone, in minutes:

    ```js run
    // if you are in timezone UTC-1, outputs 60
    // if you are in timezone UTC+3, outputs -180
    alert( new Date().getTimezoneOffset() );

    ```

## Setting date components

The following methods allow to set date/time components:

- [`setFullYear(year, [month], [date])`](mdn:js/Date/setFullYear)
- [`setMonth(month, [date])`](mdn:js/Date/setMonth)
- [`setDate(date)`](mdn:js/Date/setDate)
- [`setHours(hour, [min], [sec], [ms])`](mdn:js/Date/setHours)
- [`setMinutes(min, [sec], [ms])`](mdn:js/Date/setMinutes)
- [`setSeconds(sec, [ms])`](mdn:js/Date/setSeconds)
- [`setMilliseconds(ms)`](mdn:js/Date/setMilliseconds)
- [`setTime(milliseconds)`](mdn:js/Date/setTime) (sets the whole date by milliseconds since 01.01.1970 UTC)

Every one of them except `setTime()` has a UTC-variant, for instance: `setUTCHours()`.

As we can see, some methods can set multiple components at once, for example `setHours`. The components that are not mentioned are not modified.

For instance:

```js run
let today = new Date();

today.setHours(0);
alert(today); // still today, but the hour is changed to 0

today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
alert(today); // still today, now 00:00:00 sharp.
```

## Autocorrection

The *autocorrection* is a very handy feature of `Date` objects. We can set out-of-range values, and it will auto-adjust itself.

For instance:

```js run
let date = new Date(2013, 0, *!*32*/!*); // 32 Jan 2013 ?!?
alert(date); // ...is 1st Feb 2013!
```

Out-of-range date components are distributed automatically.

Let's say we need to increase the date "28 Feb 2016" by 2 days. It may be "2 Mar" or "1 Mar" in case of a leap-year. We don't need to think about it. Just add 2 days. The `Date` object will do the rest:

```js run
let date = new Date(2016, 1, 28);
*!*
date.setDate(date.getDate() + 2);
*/!*

alert( date ); // 1 Mar 2016
```

That feature is often used to get the date after the given period of time. For instance, let's get the date for "70 seconds after now":

```js run
let date = new Date();
date.setSeconds(date.getSeconds() + 70);

alert( date ); // shows the correct date
```

We can also set zero or even negative values. For example:

```js run
let date = new Date(2016, 0, 2); // 2 Jan 2016

date.setDate(1); // set day 1 of month
alert( date );

date.setDate(0); // min day is 1, so the last day of the previous month is assumed
alert( date ); // 31 Dec 2015
```

## Date to number, date diff

When a `Date` object is converted to number, it becomes the timestamp same as `date.getTime()`:

```js run
let date = new Date();
alert(+date); // the number of milliseconds, same as date.getTime()
```

The important side effect: dates can be subtracted, the result is their difference in ms.

That can be used for time measurements:

```js run
let start = new Date(); // start measuring time

// do the job
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  let doSomething = i * i * i;
}

let end = new Date(); // end measuring time

alert( `The loop took ${end - start} ms` );
```

## Date.now()

If we only want to measure time, we don't need the `Date` object.

There's a special method `Date.now()` that returns the current timestamp.

It is semantically equivalent to `new Date().getTime()`, but it doesn't create an intermediate `Date` object. So it's faster and doesn't put pressure on garbage collection.

It is used mostly for convenience or when performance matters, like in games in JavaScript or other specialized applications.

So this is probably better:

```js run
*!*
let start = Date.now(); // milliseconds count from 1 Jan 1970
*/!*

// do the job
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  let doSomething = i * i * i;
}

*!*
let end = Date.now(); // done
*/!*

alert( `The loop took ${end - start} ms` ); // subtract numbers, not dates
```

## Benchmarking

If we want a reliable benchmark of CPU-hungry function, we should be careful.

For instance, let's measure two functions that calculate the difference between two dates: which one is faster?

Such performance measurements are often called "benchmarks".

```js
// we have date1 and date2, which function faster returns their difference in ms?
function diffSubtract(date1, date2) {
  return date2 - date1;
}

// or
function diffGetTime(date1, date2) {
  return date2.getTime() - date1.getTime();
}
```

These two do exactly the same thing, but one of them uses an explicit `date.getTime()` to get the date in ms, and the other one relies on a date-to-number transform. Their result is always the same.

So, which one is faster?

The first idea may be to run them many times in a row and measure the time difference. For our case, functions are very simple, so we have to do it at least 100000 times.

Let's measure:

```js run
function diffSubtract(date1, date2) {
  return date2 - date1;
}

function diffGetTime(date1, date2) {
  return date2.getTime() - date1.getTime();
}

function bench(f) {
  let date1 = new Date(0);
  let date2 = new Date();

  let start = Date.now();
  for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) f(date1, date2);
  return Date.now() - start;
}

alert( 'Time of diffSubtract: ' + bench(diffSubtract) + 'ms' );
alert( 'Time of diffGetTime: ' + bench(diffGetTime) + 'ms' );
```

Wow! Using `getTime()` is so much faster! That's because there's no type conversion, it is much easier for engines to optimize.

Okay, we have something. But that's not a good benchmark yet.

Imagine that at the time of running `bench(diffSubtract)` CPU was doing something in parallel, and it was taking resources. And by the time of running `bench(diffGetTime)` that work has finished.

A pretty real scenario for a modern multi-process OS.

As a result, the first benchmark will have less CPU resources than the second. That may lead to wrong results.

**For more reliable benchmarking, the whole pack of benchmarks should be rerun multiple times.**

For example, like this:

```js run
function diffSubtract(date1, date2) {
  return date2 - date1;
}

function diffGetTime(date1, date2) {
  return date2.getTime() - date1.getTime();
}

function bench(f) {
  let date1 = new Date(0);
  let date2 = new Date();

  let start = Date.now();
  for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) f(date1, date2);
  return Date.now() - start;
}

let time1 = 0;
let time2 = 0;

*!*
// run bench(diffSubtract) and bench(diffGetTime) each 10 times alternating
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  time1 += bench(diffSubtract);
  time2 += bench(diffGetTime);
}
*/!*

alert( 'Total time for diffSubtract: ' + time1 );
alert( 'Total time for diffGetTime: ' + time2 );
```

Modern JavaScript engines start applying advanced optimizations only to "hot code" that executes many times (no need to optimize rarely executed things). So, in the example above, first executions are not well-optimized. We may want to add a heat-up run:

```js
// added for "heating up" prior to the main loop
bench(diffSubtract);
bench(diffGetTime);

// now benchmark
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  time1 += bench(diffSubtract);
  time2 += bench(diffGetTime);
}
```

```warn header="Be careful doing microbenchmarking"
Modern JavaScript engines perform many optimizations. They may tweak results of "artificial tests" compared to "normal usage", especially when we benchmark something very small, such as how an operator works, or a built-in function. So if you seriously want to understand performance, then please study how the JavaScript engine works. And then you probably won't need microbenchmarks at all.

```

## Date.parse from a string

The method [Date.parse(str)](mdn:js/Date/parse) can read a date from a string.

The string format should be: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`, where:

- `YYYY-MM-DD` -- is the date: year-month-day.
- The character `"T"` is used as the delimiter.
- `HH:mm:ss.sss` -- is the time: hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.
- The optional `'Z'` part denotes the time zone in the format `+-hh:mm`. A single letter `Z` would mean UTC+0.

Shorter variants are also possible, like `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM` or even `YYYY`.

The call to `Date.parse(str)` parses the string in the given format and returns the timestamp (number of milliseconds from 1 Jan 1970 UTC+0). If the format is invalid, returns `NaN`.

For instance:

```js run
let ms = Date.parse('2012-01-26T13:51:50.417-07:00');

alert(ms); // 1327611110417  (timestamp)
```

We can instantly create a `new Date` object from the timestamp:

```js run
let date = new Date( Date.parse('2012-01-26T13:51:50.417-07:00') );

alert(date);  
```

## Summary

- Date and time in JavaScript are represented with the [Date](mdn:js/Date) object. We can't create "only date" or "only time": `Date` objects always carry both.
- Months are counted from zero (yes, January is a zero month).
- Days of week in `getDay()` are also counted from zero (that's Sunday).
- `Date` auto-corrects itself when out-of-range components are set. Good for adding/subtracting days/months/hours.
- Dates can be subtracted, giving their difference in milliseconds. That's because a `Date` becomes the timestamp when converted to a number.
- Use `Date.now()` to get the current timestamp fast.

Note that unlike many other systems, timestamps in JavaScript are in milliseconds, not in seconds.

Sometimes we need more precise time measurements. JavaScript itself does not have a way to measure time in microseconds (1 millionth of a second), but most environments provide it. For instance, browser has [performance.now()](mdn:api/Performance/now) that gives the number of milliseconds from the start of page loading with microsecond precision (3 digits after the point):

```js run
alert(`Loading started ${performance.now()}ms ago`);
// Something like: "Loading started 34731.26000000001ms ago"
// .26 is microseconds (260 microseconds)
// more than 3 digits after the decimal point are precision errors, only the first 3 are correct
```

Node.js has `microtime` module and other ways. Technically, almost any device and environment allows to get more precision, it's just not in `Date`.
# Date and time

Let's meet a new built-in object: [Date](mdn:js/Date). It stores the date, time and provides methods for date/time management.

For instance, we can use it to store creation/modification times, to measure time, or just to print out the current date.

## Creation

To create a new `Date` object call `new Date()` with one of the following arguments:

`new Date()`
: Without arguments -- create a `Date` object for the current date and time:

    ```js run
    let now = new Date();
    alert( now ); // shows current date/time
    ```

`new Date(milliseconds)`
: Create a `Date` object with the time equal to number of milliseconds (1/1000 of a second) passed after the Jan 1st of 1970 UTC+0.

    ```js run
    // 0 means 01.01.1970 UTC+0
    let Jan01_1970 = new Date(0);
    alert( Jan01_1970 );

    // now add 24 hours, get 02.01.1970 UTC+0
    let Jan02_1970 = new Date(24 * 3600 * 1000);
    alert( Jan02_1970 );
    ```

    An integer number representing the number of milliseconds that has passed since the beginning of 1970 is called a *timestamp*.

    It's a lightweight numeric representation of a date. We can always create a date from a timestamp using `new Date(timestamp)` and convert the existing `Date` object to a timestamp using the `date.getTime()` method (see below).

    Dates before 01.01.1970 have negative timestamps, e.g.:
    ```js run
    // 31 Dec 1969
    let Dec31_1969 = new Date(-24 * 3600 * 1000);
    alert( Dec31_1969 );
    ```

`new Date(datestring)`
: If there is a single argument, and it's a string, then it is parsed automatically. The algorithm is the same as `Date.parse` uses, we'll cover it later.

    ```js run
    let date = new Date("2017-01-26");
    alert(date);
    // The time is not set, so it's assumed to be midnight GMT and
    // is adjusted according to the timezone the code is run in
    // So the result could be
    // Thu Jan 26 2017 11:00:00 GMT+1100 (Australian Eastern Daylight Time)
    // or
    // Wed Jan 25 2017 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)
    ```

`new Date(year, month, date, hours, minutes, seconds, ms)`
: Create the date with the given components in the local time zone. Only the first two arguments are obligatory.

    - The `year` must have 4 digits: `2013` is okay, `98` is not.
    - The `month` count starts with `0` (Jan), up to `11` (Dec).
    - The `date` parameter is actually the day of month, if absent then `1` is assumed.
    - If `hours/minutes/seconds/ms` is absent, they are assumed to be equal `0`.

    For instance:

    ```js
    new Date(2011, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0); // 1 Jan 2011, 00:00:00
    new Date(2011, 0, 1); // the same, hours etc are 0 by default
    ```

    The maximal precision is 1 ms (1/1000 sec):

    ```js run
    let date = new Date(2011, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 567);
    alert( date ); // 1.01.2011, 02:03:04.567
    ```

## Access date components

There are methods to access the year, month and so on from the `Date` object:

[getFullYear()](mdn:js/Date/getFullYear)
: Get the year (4 digits)

[getMonth()](mdn:js/Date/getMonth)
: Get the month, **from 0 to 11**.

[getDate()](mdn:js/Date/getDate)
: Get the day of month, from 1 to 31, the name of the method does look a little bit strange.

[getHours()](mdn:js/Date/getHours), [getMinutes()](mdn:js/Date/getMinutes), [getSeconds()](mdn:js/Date/getSeconds), [getMilliseconds()](mdn:js/Date/getMilliseconds)
: Get the corresponding time components.

```warn header="Not `getYear()`, but `getFullYear()`"
Many JavaScript engines implement a non-standard method `getYear()`. This method is deprecated. It returns 2-digit year sometimes. Please never use it. There is `getFullYear()` for the year.
```

Additionally, we can get a day of week:

[getDay()](mdn:js/Date/getDay)
: Get the day of week, from `0` (Sunday) to `6` (Saturday). The first day is always Sunday, in some countries that's not so, but can't be changed.

**All the methods above return the components relative to the local time zone.**

There are also their UTC-counterparts, that return day, month, year and so on for the time zone UTC+0: [getUTCFullYear()](mdn:js/Date/getUTCFullYear), [getUTCMonth()](mdn:js/Date/getUTCMonth), [getUTCDay()](mdn:js/Date/getUTCDay). Just insert the `"UTC"` right after `"get"`.

If your local time zone is shifted relative to UTC, then the code below shows different hours:

```js run
// current date
let date = new Date();

// the hour in your current time zone
alert( date.getHours() );

// the hour in UTC+0 time zone (London time without daylight savings)
alert( date.getUTCHours() );
```

Besides the given methods, there are two special ones that do not have a UTC-variant:

[getTime()](mdn:js/Date/getTime)
: Returns the timestamp for the date -- a number of milliseconds passed from the January 1st of 1970 UTC+0.

[getTimezoneOffset()](mdn:js/Date/getTimezoneOffset)
: Returns the difference between UTC and the local time zone, in minutes:

    ```js run
    // if you are in timezone UTC-1, outputs 60
    // if you are in timezone UTC+3, outputs -180
    alert( new Date().getTimezoneOffset() );

    ```

## Setting date components

The following methods allow to set date/time components:

- [`setFullYear(year, [month], [date])`](mdn:js/Date/setFullYear)
- [`setMonth(month, [date])`](mdn:js/Date/setMonth)
- [`setDate(date)`](mdn:js/Date/setDate)
- [`setHours(hour, [min], [sec], [ms])`](mdn:js/Date/setHours)
- [`setMinutes(min, [sec], [ms])`](mdn:js/Date/setMinutes)
- [`setSeconds(sec, [ms])`](mdn:js/Date/setSeconds)
- [`setMilliseconds(ms)`](mdn:js/Date/setMilliseconds)
- [`setTime(milliseconds)`](mdn:js/Date/setTime) (sets the whole date by milliseconds since 01.01.1970 UTC)

Every one of them except `setTime()` has a UTC-variant, for instance: `setUTCHours()`.

As we can see, some methods can set multiple components at once, for example `setHours`. The components that are not mentioned are not modified.

For instance:

```js run
let today = new Date();

today.setHours(0);
alert(today); // still today, but the hour is changed to 0

today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
alert(today); // still today, now 00:00:00 sharp.
```

## Autocorrection

The *autocorrection* is a very handy feature of `Date` objects. We can set out-of-range values, and it will auto-adjust itself.

For instance:

```js run
let date = new Date(2013, 0, *!*32*/!*); // 32 Jan 2013 ?!?
alert(date); // ...is 1st Feb 2013!
```

Out-of-range date components are distributed automatically.

Let's say we need to increase the date "28 Feb 2016" by 2 days. It may be "2 Mar" or "1 Mar" in case of a leap-year. We don't need to think about it. Just add 2 days. The `Date` object will do the rest:

```js run
let date = new Date(2016, 1, 28);
*!*
date.setDate(date.getDate() + 2);
*/!*

alert( date ); // 1 Mar 2016
```

That feature is often used to get the date after the given period of time. For instance, let's get the date for "70 seconds after now":

```js run
let date = new Date();
date.setSeconds(date.getSeconds() + 70);

alert( date ); // shows the correct date
```

We can also set zero or even negative values. For example:

```js run
let date = new Date(2016, 0, 2); // 2 Jan 2016

date.setDate(1); // set day 1 of month
alert( date );

date.setDate(0); // min day is 1, so the last day of the previous month is assumed
alert( date ); // 31 Dec 2015
```

## Date to number, date diff

When a `Date` object is converted to number, it becomes the timestamp same as `date.getTime()`:

```js run
let date = new Date();
alert(+date); // the number of milliseconds, same as date.getTime()
```

The important side effect: dates can be subtracted, the result is their difference in ms.

That can be used for time measurements:

```js run
let start = new Date(); // start measuring time

// do the job
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  let doSomething = i * i * i;
}

let end = new Date(); // end measuring time

alert( `The loop took ${end - start} ms` );
```

## Date.now()

If we only want to measure time, we don't need the `Date` object.

There's a special method `Date.now()` that returns the current timestamp.

It is semantically equivalent to `new Date().getTime()`, but it doesn't create an intermediate `Date` object. So it's faster and doesn't put pressure on garbage collection.

It is used mostly for convenience or when performance matters, like in games in JavaScript or other specialized applications.

So this is probably better:

```js run
*!*
let start = Date.now(); // milliseconds count from 1 Jan 1970
*/!*

// do the job
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  let doSomething = i * i * i;
}

*!*
let end = Date.now(); // done
*/!*

alert( `The loop took ${end - start} ms` ); // subtract numbers, not dates
```

## Benchmarking

If we want a reliable benchmark of CPU-hungry function, we should be careful.

For instance, let's measure two functions that calculate the difference between two dates: which one is faster?

Such performance measurements are often called "benchmarks".

```js
// we have date1 and date2, which function faster returns their difference in ms?
function diffSubtract(date1, date2) {
  return date2 - date1;
}

// or
function diffGetTime(date1, date2) {
  return date2.getTime() - date1.getTime();
}
```

These two do exactly the same thing, but one of them uses an explicit `date.getTime()` to get the date in ms, and the other one relies on a date-to-number transform. Their result is always the same.

So, which one is faster?

The first idea may be to run them many times in a row and measure the time difference. For our case, functions are very simple, so we have to do it at least 100000 times.

Let's measure:

```js run
function diffSubtract(date1, date2) {
  return date2 - date1;
}

function diffGetTime(date1, date2) {
  return date2.getTime() - date1.getTime();
}

function bench(f) {
  let date1 = new Date(0);
  let date2 = new Date();

  let start = Date.now();
  for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) f(date1, date2);
  return Date.now() - start;
}

alert( 'Time of diffSubtract: ' + bench(diffSubtract) + 'ms' );
alert( 'Time of diffGetTime: ' + bench(diffGetTime) + 'ms' );
```

Wow! Using `getTime()` is so much faster! That's because there's no type conversion, it is much easier for engines to optimize.

Okay, we have something. But that's not a good benchmark yet.

Imagine that at the time of running `bench(diffSubtract)` CPU was doing something in parallel, and it was taking resources. And by the time of running `bench(diffGetTime)` that work has finished.

A pretty real scenario for a modern multi-process OS.

As a result, the first benchmark will have less CPU resources than the second. That may lead to wrong results.

**For more reliable benchmarking, the whole pack of benchmarks should be rerun multiple times.**

For example, like this:

```js run
function diffSubtract(date1, date2) {
  return date2 - date1;
}

function diffGetTime(date1, date2) {
  return date2.getTime() - date1.getTime();
}

function bench(f) {
  let date1 = new Date(0);
  let date2 = new Date();

  let start = Date.now();
  for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) f(date1, date2);
  return Date.now() - start;
}

let time1 = 0;
let time2 = 0;

*!*
// run bench(diffSubtract) and bench(diffGetTime) each 10 times alternating
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  time1 += bench(diffSubtract);
  time2 += bench(diffGetTime);
}
*/!*

alert( 'Total time for diffSubtract: ' + time1 );
alert( 'Total time for diffGetTime: ' + time2 );
```

Modern JavaScript engines start applying advanced optimizations only to "hot code" that executes many times (no need to optimize rarely executed things). So, in the example above, first executions are not well-optimized. We may want to add a heat-up run:

```js
// added for "heating up" prior to the main loop
bench(diffSubtract);
bench(diffGetTime);

// now benchmark
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  time1 += bench(diffSubtract);
  time2 += bench(diffGetTime);
}
```

```warn header="Be careful doing microbenchmarking"
Modern JavaScript engines perform many optimizations. They may tweak results of "artificial tests" compared to "normal usage", especially when we benchmark something very small, such as how an operator works, or a built-in function. So if you seriously want to understand performance, then please study how the JavaScript engine works. And then you probably won't need microbenchmarks at all.

## Date.parse from a string

The method [Date.parse(str)](mdn:js/Date/parse) can read a date from a string.

The string format should be: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`, where:

- `YYYY-MM-DD` -- is the date: year-month-day.
- The character `"T"` is used as the delimiter.
- `HH:mm:ss.sss` -- is the time: hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.
- The optional `'Z'` part denotes the time zone in the format `+-hh:mm`. A single letter `Z` would mean UTC+0.

Shorter variants are also possible, like `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM` or even `YYYY`.

The call to `Date.parse(str)` parses the string in the given format and returns the timestamp (number of milliseconds from 1 Jan 1970 UTC+0). If the format is invalid, returns `NaN`.

For instance:

```js run
let ms = Date.parse('2012-01-26T13:51:50.417-07:00');

alert(ms); // 1327611110417  (timestamp)
```

We can instantly create a `new Date` object from the timestamp:

```js run
let date = new Date( Date.parse('2012-01-26T13:51:50.417-07:00') );

alert(date);  
```

## Summary

- Date and time in JavaScript are represented with the [Date](mdn:js/Date) object. We can't create "only date" or "only time": `Date` objects always carry both.
- Months are counted from zero (yes, January is a zero month).
- Days of week in `getDay()` are also counted from zero (that's Sunday).
- `Date` auto-corrects itself when out-of-range components are set. Good for adding/subtracting days/months/hours.
- Dates can be subtracted, giving their difference in milliseconds. That's because a `Date` becomes the timestamp when converted to a number.
- Use `Date.now()` to get the current timestamp fast.

Note that unlike many other systems, timestamps in JavaScript are in milliseconds, not in seconds.

Sometimes we need more precise time measurements. JavaScript itself does not have a way to measure time in microseconds (1 millionth of a second), but most environments provide it. For instance, browser has [performance.now()](mdn:api/Performance/now) that gives the number of milliseconds from the start of page loading with microsecond precision (3 digits after the point):

```js run
alert(`Loading started ${performance.now()}ms ago`);
// Something like: "Loading started 34731.26000000001ms ago"
// .26 is microseconds (260 microseconds)
// more than 3 digits after the decimal point are precision errors, only the first 3 are correct
```

Node.js has `microtime` module and other ways. Technically, almost any device and environment allows to get more precision, it's just not in `Date`.


# JSON methods, toJSON

Let's say we have a complex object, and we'd like to convert it into a string, to send it over a network, or just to output it for logging purposes.

Naturally, such a string should include all important properties.

We could implement the conversion like this:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,

*!*
  toString() {
    return `{name: "${this.name}", age: ${this.age}}`;
  }
*/!*
};

alert(user); // {name: "John", age: 30}
```

...But in the process of development, new properties are added, old properties are renamed and removed. Updating such `toString` every time can become a pain. We could try to loop over properties in it, but what if the object is complex and has nested objects in properties? We'd need to implement their conversion as well.

Luckily, there's no need to write the code to handle all this. The task has been solved already.

## JSON.stringify

The [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) (JavaScript Object Notation) is a general format to represent values and objects. It is described as in [RFC 4627](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627) standard. Initially it was made for JavaScript, but many other languages have libraries to handle it as well.  So it's easy to use JSON for data exchange when the client uses JavaScript and the server is written on Ruby/PHP/Java/Whatever.

JavaScript provides methods:

- `JSON.stringify` to convert objects into JSON.
- `JSON.parse` to convert JSON back into an object.

For instance, here we `JSON.stringify` a student:
```js run
let student = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: false,
  courses: ['html', 'css', 'js'],
  wife: null
};

*!*
let json = JSON.stringify(student);
*/!*

alert(typeof json); // we've got a string!

alert(json);
*!*
/* JSON-encoded object:
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "isAdmin": false,
  "courses": ["html", "css", "js"],
  "wife": null
}
*/
*/!*
```

The method `JSON.stringify(student)` takes the object and converts it into a string.

The resulting `json` string is called a *JSON-encoded* or *serialized* or *stringified* or *marshalled* object. We are ready to send it over the wire or put into a plain data store.


Please note that a JSON-encoded object has several important differences from the object literal:

- Strings use double quotes. No single quotes or backticks in JSON. So `'John'` becomes `"John"`.
- Object property names are double-quoted also. That's obligatory. So `age:30` becomes `"age":30`.

`JSON.stringify` can be applied to primitives as well.

JSON supports following data types:

- Objects `{ ... }`
- Arrays `[ ... ]`
- Primitives:
    - strings,
    - numbers,
    - boolean values `true/false`,
    - `null`.

For instance:

```js run
// a number in JSON is just a number
alert( JSON.stringify(1) ) // 1

// a string in JSON is still a string, but double-quoted
alert( JSON.stringify('test') ) // "test"

alert( JSON.stringify(true) ); // true

alert( JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3]) ); // [1,2,3]
```

JSON is data-only language-independent specification, so some JavaScript-specific object properties are skipped by `JSON.stringify`.

Namely:

- Function properties (methods).
- Symbolic keys and values.
- Properties that store `undefined`.

```js run
let user = {
  sayHi() { // ignored
    alert("Hello");
  },
  [Symbol("id")]: 123, // ignored
  something: undefined // ignored
};

alert( JSON.stringify(user) ); // {} (empty object)
```

Usually that's fine. If that's not what we want, then soon we'll see how to customize the process.

The great thing is that nested objects are supported and converted automatically.

For instance:

```js run
let meetup = {
  title: "Conference",
*!*
  room: {
    number: 23,
    participants: ["john", "ann"]
  }
*/!*
};

alert( JSON.stringify(meetup) );
/* The whole structure is stringified:
{
  "title":"Conference",
  "room":{"number":23,"participants":["john","ann"]},
}
*/
```

The important limitation: there must be no circular references.

For instance:

```js run
let room = {
  number: 23
};

let meetup = {
  title: "Conference",
  participants: ["john", "ann"]
};

meetup.place = room;       // meetup references room
room.occupiedBy = meetup; // room references meetup

*!*
JSON.stringify(meetup); // Error: Converting circular structure to JSON
*/!*
```

Here, the conversion fails, because of circular reference: `room.occupiedBy` references `meetup`, and `meetup.place` references `room`:

![](json-meetup.svg)


## Excluding and transforming: replacer

The full syntax of `JSON.stringify` is:

```js
let json = JSON.stringify(value[, replacer, space])
```

value
: A value to encode.

replacer
: Array of properties to encode or a mapping function `function(key, value)`.

space
: Amount of space to use for formatting

Most of the time, `JSON.stringify` is used with the first argument only. But if we need to fine-tune the replacement process, like to filter out circular references, we can use the second argument of `JSON.stringify`.

If we pass an array of properties to it, only these properties will be encoded.

For instance:

```js run
let room = {
  number: 23
};

let meetup = {
  title: "Conference",
  participants: [{name: "John"}, {name: "Alice"}],
  place: room // meetup references room
};

room.occupiedBy = meetup; // room references meetup

alert( JSON.stringify(meetup, *!*['title', 'participants']*/!*) );
// {"title":"Conference","participants":[{},{}]}
```

Here we are probably too strict. The property list is applied to the whole object structure. So the objects in `participants` are empty, because `name` is not in the list.

Let's include in the list every property except `room.occupiedBy` that would cause the circular reference:

```js run
let room = {
  number: 23
};

let meetup = {
  title: "Conference",
  participants: [{name: "John"}, {name: "Alice"}],
  place: room // meetup references room
};

room.occupiedBy = meetup; // room references meetup

alert( JSON.stringify(meetup, *!*['title', 'participants', 'place', 'name', 'number']*/!*) );
/*
{
  "title":"Conference",
  "participants":[{"name":"John"},{"name":"Alice"}],
  "place":{"number":23}
}
*/
```

Now everything except `occupiedBy` is serialized. But the list of properties is quite long.

Fortunately, we can use a function instead of an array as the `replacer`.

The function will be called for every `(key, value)` pair and should return the "replaced" value, which will be used instead of the original one. Or `undefined` if the value is to be skipped.

In our case, we can return `value` "as is" for everything except `occupiedBy`. To ignore `occupiedBy`, the code below returns `undefined`:

```js run
let room = {
  number: 23
};

let meetup = {
  title: "Conference",
  participants: [{name: "John"}, {name: "Alice"}],
  place: room // meetup references room
};

room.occupiedBy = meetup; // room references meetup

alert( JSON.stringify(meetup, function replacer(key, value) {
  alert(`${key}: ${value}`);
  return (key == 'occupiedBy') ? undefined : value;
}));

/* key:value pairs that come to replacer:
:             [object Object]
title:        Conference
participants: [object Object],[object Object]
0:            [object Object]
name:         John
1:            [object Object]
name:         Alice
place:        [object Object]
number:       23
occupiedBy: [object Object]
*/
```

Please note that `replacer` function gets every key/value pair including nested objects and array items. It is applied recursively. The value of `this` inside `replacer` is the object that contains the current property.

The first call is special. It is made using a special "wrapper object": `{"": meetup}`. In other words, the first `(key, value)` pair has an empty key, and the value is the target object as a whole. That's why the first line is `":[object Object]"` in the example above.

The idea is to provide as much power for `replacer` as possible: it has a chance to analyze and replace/skip even the whole object if necessary.


## Formatting: space

The third argument of `JSON.stringify(value, replacer, space)` is the number of spaces to use for pretty formatting.

Previously, all stringified objects had no indents and extra spaces. That's fine if we want to send an object over a network. The `space` argument is used exclusively for a nice output.

Here `space = 2` tells JavaScript to show nested objects on multiple lines, with indentation of 2 spaces inside an object:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
  roles: {
    isAdmin: false,
    isEditor: true
  }
};

alert(JSON.stringify(user, null, 2));
/* two-space indents:
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 25,
  "roles": {
    "isAdmin": false,
    "isEditor": true
  }
}
*/

/* for JSON.stringify(user, null, 4) the result would be more indented:
{
    "name": "John",
    "age": 25,
    "roles": {
        "isAdmin": false,
        "isEditor": true
    }
}
*/
```

The third argument can also be a string. In this case, the string is used for indentation instead of a number of spaces.

The `space` parameter is used solely for logging and nice-output purposes.

## Custom "toJSON"

Like `toString` for string conversion, an object may provide method `toJSON` for to-JSON conversion. `JSON.stringify` automatically calls it if available.

For instance:

```js run
let room = {
  number: 23
};

let meetup = {
  title: "Conference",
  date: new Date(Date.UTC(2017, 0, 1)),
  room
};

alert( JSON.stringify(meetup) );
/*
  {
    "title":"Conference",
*!*
    "date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",  // (1)
*/!*
    "room": {"number":23}               // (2)
  }
*/
```

Here we can see that `date` `(1)` became a string. That's because all dates have a built-in `toJSON` method which returns such kind of string.

Now let's add a custom `toJSON` for our object `room` `(2)`:

```js run
let room = {
  number: 23,
*!*
  toJSON() {
    return this.number;
  }
*/!*
};

let meetup = {
  title: "Conference",
  room
};

*!*
alert( JSON.stringify(room) ); // 23
*/!*

alert( JSON.stringify(meetup) );
/*
  {
    "title":"Conference",
*!*
    "room": 23
*/!*
  }
*/
```

As we can see, `toJSON` is used both for the direct call `JSON.stringify(room)` and when `room` is nested in another encoded object.


## JSON.parse

To decode a JSON-string, we need another method named [JSON.parse](mdn:js/JSON/parse).

The syntax:
```js
let value = JSON.parse(str, [reviver]);
```

str
: JSON-string to parse.

reviver
: Optional function(key,value) that will be called for each `(key, value)` pair and can transform the value.

For instance:

```js run
// stringified array
let numbers = "[0, 1, 2, 3]";

numbers = JSON.parse(numbers);

alert( numbers[1] ); // 1
```

Or for nested objects:

```js run
let userData = '{ "name": "John", "age": 35, "isAdmin": false, "friends": [0,1,2,3] }';

let user = JSON.parse(userData);

alert( user.friends[1] ); // 1
```

The JSON may be as complex as necessary, objects and arrays can include other objects and arrays. But they must obey the same JSON format.

Here are typical mistakes in hand-written JSON (sometimes we have to write it for debugging purposes):

```js
let json = `{
  *!*name*/!*: "John",                     // mistake: property name without quotes
  "surname": *!*'Smith'*/!*,               // mistake: single quotes in value (must be double)
  *!*'isAdmin'*/!*: false                  // mistake: single quotes in key (must be double)
  "birthday": *!*new Date(2000, 2, 3)*/!*, // mistake: no "new" is allowed, only bare values
  "friends": [0,1,2,3]              // here all fine
}`;
```

Besides, JSON does not support comments. Adding a comment to JSON makes it invalid.

There's another format named [JSON5](http://json5.org/), which allows unquoted keys, comments etc. But this is a standalone library, not in the specification of the language.

The regular JSON is that strict not because its developers are lazy, but to allow easy, reliable and very fast implementations of the parsing algorithm.

## Using reviver

Imagine, we got a stringified `meetup` object from the server.

It looks like this:

```js
// title: (meetup title), date: (meetup date)
let str = '{"title":"Conference","date":"2017-11-30T12:00:00.000Z"}';
```

...And now we need to *deserialize* it, to turn back into JavaScript object.

Let's do it by calling `JSON.parse`:

```js run
let str = '{"title":"Conference","date":"2017-11-30T12:00:00.000Z"}';

let meetup = JSON.parse(str);

*!*
alert( meetup.date.getDate() ); // Error!
*/!*
```

Whoops! An error!

The value of `meetup.date` is a string, not a `Date` object. How could `JSON.parse` know that it should transform that string into a `Date`?

Let's pass to `JSON.parse` the reviving function as the second argument, that returns all values "as is", but `date` will become a `Date`:

```js run
let str = '{"title":"Conference","date":"2017-11-30T12:00:00.000Z"}';

*!*
let meetup = JSON.parse(str, function(key, value) {
  if (key == 'date') return new Date(value);
  return value;
});
*/!*

alert( meetup.date.getDate() ); // now works!
```

By the way, that works for nested objects as well:

```js run
let schedule = `{
  "meetups": [
    {"title":"Conference","date":"2017-11-30T12:00:00.000Z"},
    {"title":"Birthday","date":"2017-04-18T12:00:00.000Z"}
  ]
}`;

schedule = JSON.parse(schedule, function(key, value) {
  if (key == 'date') return new Date(value);
  return value;
});

*!*
alert( schedule.meetups[1].date.getDate() ); // works!
*/!*
```



## Summary

- JSON is a data format that has its own independent standard and libraries for most programming languages.
- JSON supports plain objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and `null`.
- JavaScript provides methods [JSON.stringify](mdn:js/JSON/stringify) to serialize into JSON and [JSON.parse](mdn:js/JSON/parse) to read from JSON.
- Both methods support transformer functions for smart reading/writing.
- If an object has `toJSON`, then it is called by `JSON.stringify`.
