# Object references and copying

One of the fundamental differences of objects versus primitives is that objects are stored and copied "by reference", whereas primitive values: strings, numbers, booleans, etc -- are always copied "as a whole value".

That's easy to understand if we look a bit under the hood of what happens when we copy a value.

Let's start with a primitive, such as a string.

Here we put a copy of `message` into `phrase`:

```js
let message = "Hello!";
let phrase = message;
```

As a result we have two independent variables, each one storing the string `"Hello!"`.

![](variable-copy-value.svg)

Quite an obvious result, right?

Objects are not like that.

**A variable assigned to an object stores not the object itself, but its "address in memory" -- in other words "a reference" to it.**

Let's look at an example of such a variable:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John"
};
```

And here's how it's actually stored in memory:

![](variable-contains-reference.svg)

The object is stored somewhere in memory (at the right of the picture), while the `user` variable (at the left) has a "reference" to it.

We may think of an object variable, such as `user`, as like a sheet of paper with the address of the object on it.

When we perform actions with the object, e.g. take a property `user.name`, the JavaScript engine looks at what's at that address and performs the operation on the actual object.

Now here's why it's important.

**When an object variable is copied, the reference is copied, but the object itself is not duplicated.**

For instance:

```js no-beautify
let user = { name: "John" };

let admin = user; // copy the reference
```

Now we have two variables, each storing a reference to the same object:

![](variable-copy-reference.svg)

As you can see, there's still one object, but now with two variables that reference it.

We can use either variable to access the object and modify its contents:

```js run
let user = { name: 'John' };

let admin = user;

*!*
admin.name = 'Pete'; // changed by the "admin" reference
*/!*

alert(*!*user.name*/!*); // 'Pete', changes are seen from the "user" reference
```

It's as if we had a cabinet with two keys and used one of them (`admin`) to get into it and make changes. Then, if we later use another key (`user`), we are still opening the same cabinet and can access the changed contents.

## Comparison by reference

Two objects are equal only if they are the same object.

For instance, here `a` and `b` reference the same object, thus they are equal:

```js run
let a = {};
let b = a; // copy the reference

alert( a == b ); // true, both variables reference the same object
alert( a === b ); // true
```

And here two independent objects are not equal, even though they look alike (both are empty):

```js run
let a = {};
let b = {}; // two independent objects

alert( a == b ); // false
```

For comparisons like `obj1 > obj2` or for a comparison against a primitive `obj == 5`, objects are converted to primitives. We'll study how object conversions work very soon, but to tell the truth, such comparisons are needed very rarely -- usually they appear as a result of a programming mistake.

## Cloning and merging, Object.assign [#cloning-and-merging-object-assign]

So, copying an object variable creates one more reference to the same object.

But what if we need to duplicate an object? Create an independent copy, a clone?

That's also doable, but a little bit more difficult, because there's no built-in method for that in JavaScript. But there is rarely a need -- copying by reference is good most of the time.

But if we really want that, then we need to create a new object and replicate the structure of the existing one by iterating over its properties and copying them on the primitive level.

Like this:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

*!*
let clone = {}; // the new empty object

// let's copy all user properties into it
for (let key in user) {
  clone[key] = user[key];
}
*/!*

// now clone is a fully independent object with the same content
clone.name = "Pete"; // changed the data in it

alert( user.name ); // still John in the original object
```

Also we can use the method [Object.assign](mdn:js/Object/assign) for that.

The syntax is:

```js
Object.assign(dest, [src1, src2, src3...])
```

- The first argument `dest` is a target object.
- Further arguments `src1, ..., srcN` (can be as many as needed) are source objects.
- It copies the properties of all source objects `src1, ..., srcN` into the target `dest`. In other words, properties of all arguments starting from the second are copied into the first object.
- The call returns `dest`.

For instance, we can use it to merge several objects into one:
```js
let user = { name: "John" };

let permissions1 = { canView: true };
let permissions2 = { canEdit: true };

*!*
// copies all properties from permissions1 and permissions2 into user
Object.assign(user, permissions1, permissions2);
*/!*

// now user = { name: "John", canView: true, canEdit: true }
```

If the copied property name already exists, it gets overwritten:

```js run
let user = { name: "John" };

Object.assign(user, { name: "Pete" });

alert(user.name); // now user = { name: "Pete" }
```

We also can use `Object.assign` to replace `for..in` loop for simple cloning:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

*!*
let clone = Object.assign({}, user);
*/!*
```

It copies all properties of `user` into the empty object and returns it.

There are also other methods of cloning an object, e.g. using the [spread syntax](info:rest-parameters-spread) `clone = {...user}`, covered later in the tutorial.

## Nested cloning

Until now we assumed that all properties of `user` are primitive. But properties can be references to other objects. What to do with them?

Like this:
```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  sizes: {
    height: 182,
    width: 50
  }
};

alert( user.sizes.height ); // 182
```

Now it's not enough to copy `clone.sizes = user.sizes`, because the `user.sizes` is an object, it will be copied by reference. So `clone` and `user` will share the same sizes:

Like this:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  sizes: {
    height: 182,
    width: 50
  }
};

let clone = Object.assign({}, user);

alert( user.sizes === clone.sizes ); // true, same object

// user and clone share sizes
user.sizes.width++;       // change a property from one place
alert(clone.sizes.width); // 51, see the result from the other one
```

To fix that, we should use a cloning loop that examines each value of `user[key]` and, if it's an object, then replicate its structure as well. That is called a "deep cloning".

We can use recursion to implement it. Or, to not reinvent the wheel, take an existing implementation, for instance [_.cloneDeep(obj)](https://lodash.com/docs#cloneDeep) from the JavaScript library [lodash](https://lodash.com).

%%smart header="Const objects can be modified"
An important side effect of storing objects as references is that an object declared as `const` *can* be modified.

For instance:

```js run
const user = {
  name: "John"
};

*!*
user.name = "Pete"; // (*)
*/!*

alert(user.name); // Pete
```

It might seem that the line `(*)` would cause an error, but it does not. The value of `user` is constant, it must always reference the same object, but properties of that object are free to change.

In other words, the `const user` gives an error only if we try to set `user=...` as a whole.

That said, if we really need to make constant object properties, it's also possible, but using totally different methods. We'll mention that in the chapter <info:property-descriptors>.
%%

## Summary

Objects are assigned and copied by reference. In other words, a variable stores not the "object value", but a "reference" (address in memory) for the value. So copying such a variable or passing it as a function argument copies that reference, not the object itself.

All operations via copied references (like adding/removing properties) are performed on the same single object.

To make a "real copy" (a clone) we can use `Object.assign` for the so-called "shallow copy" (nested objects are copied by reference) or a "deep cloning" function, such as [_.cloneDeep(obj)](https://lodash.com/docs#cloneDeep).

# Garbage collection

Memory management in JavaScript is performed automatically and invisibly to us. We create primitives, objects, functions... All that takes memory.

What happens when something is not needed any more? How does the JavaScript engine discover it and clean it up?

## Reachability

The main concept of memory management in JavaScript is *reachability*.

Simply put, "reachable" values are those that are accessible or usable somehow. They are guaranteed to be stored in memory.

1. There's a base set of inherently reachable values, that cannot be deleted for obvious reasons.

    For instance:

    - The currently executing function, its local variables and parameters.
    - Other functions on the current chain of nested calls, their local variables and parameters.
    - Global variables.
    - (there are some other, internal ones as well)

    These values are called *roots*.

2. Any other value is considered reachable if it's reachable from a root by a reference or by a chain of references.

    For instance, if there's an object in a global variable, and that object has a property referencing another object, *that* object is considered reachable. And those that it references are also reachable. Detailed examples to follow.

There's a background process in the JavaScript engine that is called [garbage collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)). It monitors all objects and removes those that have become unreachable.

## A simple example

Here's the simplest example:

```js
// user has a reference to the object
let user = {
  name: "John"
};
```

![](memory-user-john.svg)

Here the arrow depicts an object reference. The global variable `"user"` references the object `{name: "John"}` (we'll call it John for brevity). The `"name"` property of John stores a primitive, so it's painted inside the object.

If the value of `user` is overwritten, the reference is lost:

```js
user = null;
```

![](memory-user-john-lost.svg)

Now John becomes unreachable. There's no way to access it, no references to it. Garbage collector will junk the data and free the memory.

## Two references

Now let's imagine we copied the reference from `user` to `admin`:

```js
// user has a reference to the object
let user = {
  name: "John"
};

*!*
let admin = user;
*/!*
```

![](memory-user-john-admin.svg)

Now if we do the same:
```js
user = null;
```

...Then the object is still reachable via `admin` global variable, so it's in memory. If we overwrite `admin` too, then it can be removed.

## Interlinked objects

Now a more complex example. The family:

```js
function marry(man, woman) {
  woman.husband = man;
  man.wife = woman;

  return {
    father: man,
    mother: woman
  }
}

let family = marry({
  name: "John"
}, {
  name: "Ann"
});
```

Function `marry` "marries" two objects by giving them references to each other and returns a new object that contains them both.

The resulting memory structure:

![](family.svg)

As of now, all objects are reachable.

Now let's remove two references:

```js
delete family.father;
delete family.mother.husband;
```

![](family-delete-refs.svg)

It's not enough to delete only one of these two references, because all objects would still be reachable.

But if we delete both, then we can see that John has no incoming reference any more:

![](family-no-father.svg)

Outgoing references do not matter. Only incoming ones can make an object reachable. So, John is now unreachable and will be removed from the memory with all its data that also became unaccessible.

After garbage collection:

![](family-no-father-2.svg)

## Unreachable island

It is possible that the whole island of interlinked objects becomes unreachable and is removed from the memory.

The source object is the same as above. Then:

```js
family = null;
```

The in-memory picture becomes:

![](family-no-family.svg)

This example demonstrates how important the concept of reachability is.

It's obvious that John and Ann are still linked, both have incoming references. But that's not enough.

The former `"family"` object has been unlinked from the root, there's no reference to it any more, so the whole island becomes unreachable and will be removed.

## Internal algorithms

The basic garbage collection algorithm is called "mark-and-sweep".

The following "garbage collection" steps are regularly performed:

- The garbage collector takes roots and "marks" (remembers) them.
- Then it visits and "marks" all references from them.
- Then it visits marked objects and marks *their* references. All visited objects are remembered, so as not to visit the same object twice in the future.
- ...And so on until every reachable (from the roots) references are visited.
- All objects except marked ones are removed.

For instance, let our object structure look like this:

![](garbage-collection-1.svg)

We can clearly see an "unreachable island" to the right side. Now let's see how "mark-and-sweep" garbage collector deals with it.

The first step marks the roots:

![](garbage-collection-2.svg)

Then their references are marked:

![](garbage-collection-3.svg)

...And their references, while possible:

![](garbage-collection-4.svg)

Now the objects that could not be visited in the process are considered unreachable and will be removed:

![](garbage-collection-5.svg)

We can also imagine the process as spilling a huge bucket of paint from the roots, that flows through all references and marks all reachable objects. The unmarked ones are then removed.

That's the concept of how garbage collection works. JavaScript engines apply many optimizations to make it run faster and not affect the execution.

Some of the optimizations:

- **Generational collection** -- objects are split into two sets: "new ones" and "old ones". Many  objects appear, do their job and die fast, they can be cleaned up aggressively. Those that survive for long enough, become "old" and are examined less often.
- **Incremental collection** -- if there are many objects, and we try to walk and mark the whole object set at once, it may take some time and introduce visible delays in the execution. So the engine tries to split the garbage collection into pieces. Then the pieces are executed one by one, separately. That requires some extra bookkeeping between them to track changes, but we have many tiny delays instead of a big one.
- **Idle-time collection** -- the garbage collector tries to run only while the CPU is idle, to reduce the possible effect on the execution.

There exist other optimizations and flavours of garbage collection algorithms. As much as I'd like to describe them here, I have to hold off, because different engines implement different tweaks and techniques. And, what's even more important, things change as engines develop, so studying deeper "in advance", without a real need is probably not worth that. Unless, of course, it is a matter of pure interest, then there will be some links for you below.

## Summary

The main things to know:

- Garbage collection is performed automatically. We cannot force or prevent it.
- Objects are retained in memory while they are reachable.
- Being referenced is not the same as being reachable (from a root): a pack of interlinked objects can become unreachable as a whole.

Modern engines implement advanced algorithms of garbage collection.

A general book "The Garbage Collection Handbook: The Art of Automatic Memory Management" (R. Jones et al) covers some of them.

If you are familiar with low-level programming, the more detailed information about V8 garbage collector is in the article [A tour of V8: Garbage Collection](http://jayconrod.com/posts/55/a-tour-of-v8-garbage-collection).

[V8 blog](https://v8.dev/) also publishes articles about changes in memory management from time to time. Naturally, to learn the garbage collection, you'd better prepare by learning about V8 internals in general and read the blog of [Vyacheslav Egorov](http://mrale.ph) who worked as one of V8 engineers. I'm saying: "V8", because it is best covered with articles in the internet. For other engines, many approaches are similar, but garbage collection differs in many aspects.

In-depth knowledge of engines is good when you need low-level optimizations. It would be wise to plan that as the next step after you're familiar with the language.  


# Object methods, "this"

Objects are usually created to represent entities of the real world, like users, orders and so on:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};
```

And, in the real world, a user can *act*: select something from the shopping cart, login, logout etc.

Actions are represented in JavaScript by functions in properties.

## Method examples

For a start, let's teach the `user` to say hello:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

*!*
user.sayHi = function() {
  alert("Hello!");
};
*/!*

user.sayHi(); // Hello!
```

Here we've just used a Function Expression to create a function and assign it to the property `user.sayHi` of the object.

Then we can call it as `user.sayHi()`. The user can now speak!

A function that is a property of an object is called its *method*.

So, here we've got a method `sayHi` of the object `user`.

Of course, we could use a pre-declared function as a method, like this:

```js run
let user = {
  // ...
};

*!*
// first, declare
function sayHi() {
  alert("Hello!");
};

// then add as a method
user.sayHi = sayHi;
*/!*

user.sayHi(); // Hello!
```

```smart header="Object-oriented programming"
When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that's called [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), in short: "OOP".

OOP is a big thing, an interesting science of its own. How to choose the right entities? How to organize the interaction between them? That's architecture, and there are great books on that topic, like "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by E. Gamma, R. Helm, R. Johnson, J. Vissides or "Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications" by G. Booch, and more.
```
### Method shorthand

There exists a shorter syntax for methods in an object literal:

```js
// these objects do the same

user = {
  sayHi: function() {
    alert("Hello");
  }
};

// method shorthand looks better, right?
user = {
*!*
  sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function(){...}"
*/!*
    alert("Hello");
  }
};
```

As demonstrated, we can omit `"function"` and just write `sayHi()`.

To tell the truth, the notations are not fully identical. There are subtle differences related to object inheritance (to be covered later), but for now they do not matter. In almost all cases the shorter syntax is preferred.

## "this" in methods

It's common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job.

For instance, the code inside `user.sayHi()` may need the name of the `user`.

**To access the object, a method can use the `this` keyword.**

The value of `this` is the object "before dot", the one used to call the method.

For instance:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,

  sayHi() {
*!*
    // "this" is the "current object"
    alert(this.name);
*/!*
  }

};

user.sayHi(); // John
```

Here during the execution of `user.sayHi()`, the value of `this` will be `user`.

Technically, it's also possible to access the object without `this`, by referencing it via the outer variable:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,

  sayHi() {
*!*
    alert(user.name); // "user" instead of "this"
*/!*
  }

};
```

...But such code is unreliable. If we decide to copy `user` to another variable, e.g. `admin = user` and overwrite `user` with something else, then it will access the wrong object.

That's demonstrated below:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,

  sayHi() {
*!*
    alert( user.name ); // leads to an error
*/!*
  }

};


let admin = user;
user = null; // overwrite to make things obvious

*!*
admin.sayHi(); // TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null
*/!*
```

If we used `this.name` instead of `user.name` inside the `alert`, then the code would work.

## "this" is not bound

In JavaScript, keyword `this` behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if it's not a method of an object.

There's no syntax error in the following example:

```js
function sayHi() {
  alert( *!*this*/!*.name );
}
```

The value of `this` is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context.

For instance, here the same function is assigned to two different objects and has different "this" in the calls:

```js run
let user = { name: "John" };
let admin = { name: "Admin" };

function sayHi() {
  alert( this.name );
}

*!*
// use the same function in two objects
user.f = sayHi;
admin.f = sayHi;
*/!*

// these calls have different this
// "this" inside the function is the object "before the dot"
user.f(); // John  (this == user)
admin.f(); // Admin  (this == admin)

admin['f'](); // Admin (dot or square brackets access the method – doesn't matter)
```

The rule is simple: if `obj.f()` is called, then `this` is `obj` during the call of `f`. So it's either `user` or `admin` in the example above.

%%smart header="Calling without an object: `this == undefined`"
We can even call the function without an object at all:

```js run
function sayHi() {
  alert(this);
}

sayHi(); // undefined
```

In this case `this` is `undefined` in strict mode. If we try to access `this.name`, there will be an error.

In non-strict mode the value of `this` in such case will be the *global object* (`window` in a browser, we'll get to it later in the chapter [](info:global-object)). This is a historical behavior that `"use strict"` fixes.

Usually such call is a programming error. If there's `this` inside a function, it expects to be called in an object context.
%%

```smart header="The consequences of unbound `this`"
If you come from another programming language, then you are probably used to the idea of a "bound `this`", where methods defined in an object always have `this` referencing that object.

In JavaScript `this` is "free", its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method was declared, but rather on what object is "before the dot".

The concept of run-time evaluated `this` has both pluses and minuses. On the one hand, a function can be reused for different objects. On the other hand, the greater flexibility creates more possibilities for mistakes.

Here our position is not to judge whether this language design decision is good or bad. We'll understand how to work with it, how to get benefits and avoid problems.
```

## Arrow functions have no "this"

Arrow functions are special: they don't have their "own" `this`. If we reference `this` from such a function, it's taken from the outer "normal" function.

For instance, here `arrow()` uses `this` from the outer `user.sayHi()` method:

```js run
let user = {
  firstName: "Ilya",
  sayHi() {
    let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
    arrow();
  }
};

user.sayHi(); // Ilya
```

That's a special feature of arrow functions, it's useful when we actually do not want to have a separate `this`, but rather to take it from the outer context. Later in the chapter <info:arrow-functions> we'll go more deeply into arrow functions.


## Summary

- Functions that are stored in object properties are called "methods".
- Methods allow objects to "act" like `object.doSomething()`.
- Methods can reference the object as `this`.

The value of `this` is defined at run-time.
- When a function is declared, it may use `this`, but that `this` has no value until the function is called.
- A function can be copied between objects.
- When a function is called in the "method" syntax: `object.method()`, the value of `this` during the call is `object`.

Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no `this`. When `this` is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from outside.


# Constructor, operator "new"

The regular `{...}` syntax allows to create one object. But often we need to create many similar objects, like multiple users or menu items and so on.

That can be done using constructor functions and the `"new"` operator.

## Constructor function

Constructor functions technically are regular functions. There are two conventions though:

1. They are named with capital letter first.
2. They should be executed only with `"new"` operator.

For instance:

```js run
function User(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.isAdmin = false;
}

*!*
let user = new User("Jack");
*/!*

alert(user.name); // Jack
alert(user.isAdmin); // false
```

When a function is executed with `new`, it does the following steps:

1. A new empty object is created and assigned to `this`.
2. The function body executes. Usually it modifies `this`, adds new properties to it.
3. The value of `this` is returned.

In other words, `new User(...)` does something like:

```js
function User(name) {
*!*
  // this = {};  (implicitly)
*/!*

  // add properties to this
  this.name = name;
  this.isAdmin = false;

*!*
  // return this;  (implicitly)
*/!*
}
```

So `let user = new User("Jack")` gives the same result as:

```js
let user = {
  name: "Jack",
  isAdmin: false
};
```

Now if we want to create other users, we can call `new User("Ann")`, `new User("Alice")` and so on. Much shorter than using literals every time, and also easy to read.

That's the main purpose of constructors -- to implement reusable object creation code.

Let's note once again -- technically, any function (except arrow functions, as they don't have `this`) can be used as a constructor. It can be run with `new`, and it will execute the algorithm above. The "capital letter first" is a common agreement, to make it clear that a function is to be run with `new`.

%%smart header="new function() { ... }"
If we have many lines of code all about creation of a single complex object, we can wrap them in an immediately called constructor function, like this:

```js
// create a function and immediately call it with new
let user = new function() { 
  this.name = "John";
  this.isAdmin = false;

  // ...other code for user creation
  // maybe complex logic and statements
  // local variables etc
};
```

This constructor can't be called again, because it is not saved anywhere, just created and called. So this trick aims to encapsulate the code that constructs the single object, without future reuse.
%%

## Constructor mode test: new.target

```smart header="Advanced stuff"
The syntax from this section is rarely used, skip it unless you want to know everything.
```

Inside a function, we can check whether it was called with `new` or without it, using a special `new.target` property.

It is undefined for regular calls and equals the function if called with `new`:

```js run
function User() {
  alert(new.target);
}

// without "new":
*!*
User(); // undefined
*/!*

// with "new":
*!*
new User(); // function User { ... }
*/!*
```

That can be used inside the function to know whether it was called with `new`, "in constructor mode", or without it, "in regular mode".

We can also make both `new` and regular calls to do the same, like this:

```js run
function User(name) {
  if (!new.target) { // if you run me without new
    return new User(name); // ...I will add new for you
  }

  this.name = name;
}

let john = User("John"); // redirects call to new User
alert(john.name); // John
```

This approach is sometimes used in libraries to make the syntax more flexible. So that people may call the function with or without `new`, and it still works.

Probably not a good thing to use everywhere though, because omitting `new` makes it a bit less obvious what's going on. With `new` we all know that the new object is being created.

## Return from constructors

Usually, constructors do not have a `return` statement. Their task is to write all necessary stuff into `this`, and it automatically becomes the result.

But if there is a `return` statement, then the rule is simple:

- If `return` is called with an object, then the object is returned instead of `this`.
- If `return` is called with a primitive, it's ignored.

In other words, `return` with an object returns that object, in all other cases `this` is returned.

For instance, here `return` overrides `this` by returning an object:

```js run
function BigUser() {

  this.name = "John";

  return { name: "Godzilla" };  // <-- returns this object
}

alert( new BigUser().name );  // Godzilla, got that object
```

And here's an example with an empty `return` (or we could place a primitive after it, doesn't matter):

```js run
function SmallUser() {

  this.name = "John";

  return; // <-- returns this
}

alert( new SmallUser().name );  // John
```

Usually constructors don't have a `return` statement. Here we mention the special behavior with returning objects mainly for the sake of completeness.

%%smart header="Omitting parentheses"
By the way, we can omit parentheses after `new`, if it has no arguments:

```js
let user = new User; // <-- no parentheses
// same as
let user = new User();
```

Omitting parentheses here is not considered a "good style", but the syntax is permitted by specification.
%%

## Methods in constructor

Using constructor functions to create objects gives a great deal of flexibility. The constructor function may have parameters that define how to construct the object, and what to put in it.

Of course, we can add to `this` not only properties, but methods as well.

For instance, `new User(name)` below creates an object with the given `name` and the method `sayHi`:

```js run
function User(name) {
  this.name = name;

  this.sayHi = function() {
    alert( "My name is: " + this.name );
  };
}

*!*
let john = new User("John");

john.sayHi(); // My name is: John
*/!*

/*
john = {
   name: "John",
   sayHi: function() { ... }
}
*/
```

To create complex objects, there's a more advanced syntax, [classes](info:classes), that we'll cover later.

## Summary

- Constructor functions or, briefly, constructors, are regular functions, but there's a common agreement to name them with capital letter first.
- Constructor functions should only be called using `new`. Such a call implies a creation of empty `this` at the start and returning the populated one at the end.

We can use constructor functions to make multiple similar objects.

JavaScript provides constructor functions for many built-in language objects: like `Date` for dates, `Set` for sets and others that we plan to study.

```smart header="Objects, we'll be back!"
In this chapter we only cover the basics about objects and constructors. They are essential for learning more about data types and functions in the next chapters.

After we learn that, we return to objects and cover them in-depth in the chapters <info:prototypes> and <info:classes>.

# Optional chaining '?.'

[recent browser="new"]

The optional chaining `?.` is a safe way to access nested object properties, even if an intermediate property doesn't exist.

## The "non-existing property" problem

If you've just started to read the tutorial and learn JavaScript, maybe the problem hasn't touched you yet, but it's quite common.

As an example, let's say we have `user` objects that hold the information about our users.

Most of our users have addresses in `user.address` property, with the street `user.address.street`, but some did not provide them.

In such case, when we attempt to get `user.address.street`, and the user happens to be without an address, we get an error:

```js run
let user = {}; // a user without "address" property

alert(user.address.street); // Error!
```

That's the expected result. JavaScript works like this. As `user.address` is `undefined`, an attempt to get `user.address.street` fails with an error.

In many practical cases we'd prefer to get `undefined` instead of an error here (meaning "no street").

...And another example. In the web development, we can get an object that corresponds to a web page element using a special method call, such as `document.querySelector('.elem')`, and it returns `null` when there's no such element.

```js run
// document.querySelector('.elem') is null if there's no element
let html = document.querySelector('.elem').innerHTML; // error if it's null
```

Once again, if the element doesn't exist, we'll get an error accessing `.innerHTML` of `null`. And in some cases, when the absence of the element is normal, we'd like to avoid the error and just accept `html = null` as the result.

How can we do this?

The obvious solution would be to check the value using `if` or the conditional operator `?`, before accessing its property, like this:

```js
let user = {};

alert(user.address ? user.address.street : undefined);
```

It works, there's no error... But it's quite inelegant. As you can see, the `"user.address"` appears twice in the code. For more deeply nested properties, that becomes a problem as more repetitions are required.

E.g. let's try getting `user.address.street.name`.

We need to check both `user.address` and `user.address.street`:

```js
let user = {}; // user has no address

alert(user.address ? user.address.street ? user.address.street.name : null : null);
```

That's just awful, one may even have problems understanding such code.

Don't even care to, as there's a better way to write it, using the `&&` operator:

```js run
let user = {}; // user has no address

alert( user.address && user.address.street && user.address.street.name ); // undefined (no error)
```

AND'ing the whole path to the property ensures that all components exist (if not, the evaluation stops), but also isn't ideal.

As you can see, property names are still duplicated in the code. E.g. in the code above, `user.address` appears three times.

That's why the optional chaining `?.` was added to the language. To solve this problem once and for all!

## Optional chaining

The optional chaining `?.` stops the evaluation if the value before `?.` is `undefined` or `null` and returns `undefined`.

**Further in this article, for brevity, we'll be saying that something "exists" if it's not `null` and not `undefined`.**

In other words, `value?.prop`:
- works as `value.prop`, if `value` exists,
- otherwise (when `value` is `undefined/null`) it returns `undefined`.

Here's the safe way to access `user.address.street` using `?.`:

```js run
let user = {}; // user has no address

alert( user?.address?.street ); // undefined (no error)
```

The code is short and clean, there's no duplication at all.

Reading the address with `user?.address` works even if `user` object doesn't exist:

```js run
let user = null;

alert( user?.address ); // undefined
alert( user?.address.street ); // undefined
```

Please note: the `?.` syntax makes optional the value before it, but not any further.

E.g. in `user?.address.street.name` the `?.` allows `user` to safely be `null/undefined` (and returns `undefined` in that case), but that's only for `user`. Further properties are accessed in a regular way. If we want some of them to be optional, then we'll need to replace more `.` with `?.`.

```warn header="Don't overuse the optional chaining"
We should use `?.` only where it's ok that something doesn't exist.

For example, if according to our coding logic `user` object must exist, but `address` is optional, then we should write `user.address?.street`, but not `user?.address?.street`.

So, if `user` happens to be undefined due to a mistake, we'll see a programming error about it and fix it. Otherwise, coding errors can be silenced where not appropriate, and become more difficult to debug.
```

%%warn header="The variable before `?.` must be declared"
If there's no variable `user` at all, then `user?.anything` triggers an error:

```js run
// ReferenceError: user is not defined
user?.address;
```
The variable must be declared (e.g. `let/const/var user` or as a function parameter). The optional chaining works only for declared variables.
%%

## Short-circuiting

As it was said before, the `?.` immediately stops ("short-circuits") the evaluation if the left part doesn't exist.

So, if there are any further function calls or side effects, they don't occur.

For instance:

```js run
let user = null;
let x = 0;

user?.sayHi(x++); // no "sayHi", so the execution doesn't reach x++

alert(x); // 0, value not incremented
```

## Other variants: ?.(), ?.[]

The optional chaining `?.` is not an operator, but a special syntax construct, that also works with functions and square brackets.

For example, `?.()` is used to call a function that may not exist.

In the code below, some of our users have `admin` method, and some don't:

```js run
let userAdmin = {
  admin() {
    alert("I am admin");
  }
};

let userGuest = {};

*!*
userAdmin.admin?.(); // I am admin
*/!*

*!*
userGuest.admin?.(); // nothing (no such method)
*/!*
```

Here, in both lines we first use the dot (`userAdmin.admin`) to get `admin` property, because we assume that the user object exists, so it's safe read from it.

Then `?.()` checks the left part: if the admin function exists, then it runs (that's so for `userAdmin`). Otherwise (for `userGuest`) the evaluation stops without errors.

The `?.[]` syntax also works, if we'd like to use brackets `[]` to access properties instead of dot `.`. Similar to previous cases, it allows to safely read a property from an object that may not exist.

```js run
let key = "firstName";

let user1 = {
  firstName: "John"
};

let user2 = null; 

alert( user1?.[key] ); // John
alert( user2?.[key] ); // undefined
```

Also we can use `?.` with `delete`:

```js run
delete user?.name; // delete user.name if user exists
```

%%warn header="We can use `?.` for safe reading and deleting, but not writing"
The optional chaining `?.` has no use at the left side of an assignment.

For example:
```js run
let user = null;

user?.name = "John"; // Error, doesn't work
// because it evaluates to undefined = "John"
```

It's just not that smart.
%%

## Summary

The optional chaining `?.` syntax has three forms:

1. `obj?.prop` -- returns `obj.prop` if `obj` exists, otherwise `undefined`.
2. `obj?.[prop]` -- returns `obj[prop]` if `obj` exists, otherwise `undefined`.
3. `obj.method?.()` -- calls `obj.method()` if `obj.method` exists, otherwise returns `undefined`.

As we can see, all of them are straightforward and simple to use. The `?.` checks the left part for `null/undefined` and allows the evaluation to proceed if it's not so.

A chain of `?.` allows to safely access nested properties.

Still, we should apply `?.` carefully, only where it's acceptable that the left part doesn't exist. So that it won't hide programming errors from us, if they occur.



# Symbol type

By specification, object property keys may be either of string type, or of symbol type. Not numbers, not booleans, only strings or symbols, these two types.

Till now we've been using only strings. Now let's see the benefits that symbols can give us.

## Symbols

A "symbol" represents a unique identifier.

A value of this type can be created using `Symbol()`:

```js
// id is a new symbol
let id = Symbol();
```

Upon creation, we can give symbol a description (also called a symbol name), mostly useful for debugging purposes:

```js
// id is a symbol with the description "id"
let id = Symbol("id");
```

Symbols are guaranteed to be unique. Even if we create many symbols with the same description, they are different values. The description is just a label that doesn't affect anything.

For instance, here are two symbols with the same description -- they are not equal:

```js run
let id1 = Symbol("id");
let id2 = Symbol("id");

*!*
alert(id1 == id2); // false
*/!*
```

If you are familiar with Ruby or another language that also has some sort of "symbols" -- please don't be misguided. JavaScript symbols are different.

%%warn header="Symbols don't auto-convert to a string"
Most values in JavaScript support implicit conversion to a string. For instance, we can `alert` almost any value, and it will work. Symbols are special. They don't auto-convert.

For instance, this `alert` will show an error:

```js run
let id = Symbol("id");
*!*
alert(id); // TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string
*/!*
```

That's a "language guard" against messing up, because strings and symbols are fundamentally different and should not accidentally convert one into another.

If we really want to show a symbol, we need to explicitly call `.toString()` on it, like here:
```js run
let id = Symbol("id");
*!*
alert(id.toString()); // Symbol(id), now it works
*/!*
```

Or get `symbol.description` property to show the description only:
```js run
let id = Symbol("id");
*!*
alert(id.description); // id
*/!*
```

%%

## "Hidden" properties

Symbols allow us to create "hidden" properties of an object, that no other part of code can accidentally access or overwrite.

For instance, if we're working with `user` objects, that belong to a third-party code. We'd like to add identifiers to them.

Let's use a symbol key for it:

```js run
let user = { // belongs to another code
  name: "John"
};

let id = Symbol("id");

user[id] = 1;

alert( user[id] ); // we can access the data using the symbol as the key
```

What's the benefit of using `Symbol("id")` over a string `"id"`?

As `user` objects belongs to another code, and that code also works with them, we shouldn't just add any fields to it. That's unsafe. But a symbol cannot be accessed accidentally, the third-party code probably won't even see it, so it's probably all right to do.

Also, imagine that another script wants to have its own identifier inside `user`, for its own purposes. That may be another JavaScript library, so that the scripts are completely unaware of each other.

Then that script can create its own `Symbol("id")`, like this:

```js
// ...
let id = Symbol("id");

user[id] = "Their id value";
```

There will be no conflict between our and their identifiers, because symbols are always different, even if they have the same name.

...But if we used a string `"id"` instead of a symbol for the same purpose, then there *would* be a conflict:

```js
let user = { name: "John" };

// Our script uses "id" property
user.id = "Our id value";

// ...Another script also wants "id" for its purposes...

user.id = "Their id value"
// Boom! overwritten by another script!
```

### Symbols in an object literal

If we want to use a symbol in an object literal `{...}`, we need square brackets around it.

Like this:

```js
let id = Symbol("id");

let user = {
  name: "John",
*!*
  [id]: 123 // not "id": 123
*/!*
};
```
That's because we need the value from the variable `id` as the key, not the string "id".

### Symbols are skipped by for..in

Symbolic properties do not participate in `for..in` loop.

For instance:

```js run
let id = Symbol("id");
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  [id]: 123
};

*!*
for (let key in user) alert(key); // name, age (no symbols)
*/!*

// the direct access by the symbol works
alert( "Direct: " + user[id] );
```

`Object.keys(user)` also ignores them. That's a part of the general "hiding symbolic properties" principle. If another script or a library loops over our object, it won't unexpectedly access a symbolic property.

In contrast, [Object.assign](mdn:js/Object/assign) copies both string and symbol properties:

```js run
let id = Symbol("id");
let user = {
  [id]: 123
};

let clone = Object.assign({}, user);

alert( clone[id] ); // 123
```

There's no paradox here. That's by design. The idea is that when we clone an object or merge objects, we usually want *all* properties to be copied (including symbols like `id`).

## Global symbols

As we've seen, usually all symbols are different, even if they have the same name. But sometimes we want same-named symbols to be same entities. For instance, different parts of our application want to access symbol `"id"` meaning exactly the same property.

To achieve that, there exists a *global symbol registry*. We can create symbols in it and access them later, and it guarantees that repeated accesses by the same name return exactly the same symbol.

In order to read (create if absent) a symbol from the registry, use `Symbol.for(key)`.

That call checks the global registry, and if there's a symbol described as `key`, then returns it, otherwise creates a new symbol `Symbol(key)` and stores it in the registry by the given `key`.

For instance:

```js run
// read from the global registry
let id = Symbol.for("id"); // if the symbol did not exist, it is created

// read it again (maybe from another part of the code)
let idAgain = Symbol.for("id");

// the same symbol
alert( id === idAgain ); // true
```

Symbols inside the registry are called *global symbols*. If we want an application-wide symbol, accessible everywhere in the code -- that's what they are for.

```smart header="That sounds like Ruby"
In some programming languages, like Ruby, there's a single symbol per name.

In JavaScript, as we can see, that's right for global symbols.
```

### Symbol.keyFor

For global symbols, not only `Symbol.for(key)` returns a symbol by name, but there's a reverse call: `Symbol.keyFor(sym)`, that does the reverse: returns a name by a global symbol.

For instance:

```js run
// get symbol by name
let sym = Symbol.for("name");
let sym2 = Symbol.for("id");

// get name by symbol
alert( Symbol.keyFor(sym) ); // name
alert( Symbol.keyFor(sym2) ); // id
```

The `Symbol.keyFor` internally uses the global symbol registry to look up the key for the symbol. So it doesn't work for non-global symbols. If the symbol is not global, it won't be able to find it and returns `undefined`.

That said, any symbols have `description` property.

For instance:

```js run
let globalSymbol = Symbol.for("name");
let localSymbol = Symbol("name");

alert( Symbol.keyFor(globalSymbol) ); // name, global symbol
alert( Symbol.keyFor(localSymbol) ); // undefined, not global

alert( localSymbol.description ); // name
```

## System symbols

There exist many "system" symbols that JavaScript uses internally, and we can use them to fine-tune various aspects of our objects.

They are listed in the specification in the [Well-known symbols](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-well-known-symbols) table:

- `Symbol.hasInstance`
- `Symbol.isConcatSpreadable`
- `Symbol.iterator`
- `Symbol.toPrimitive`
- ...and so on.

For instance, `Symbol.toPrimitive` allows us to describe object to primitive conversion. We'll see its use very soon.

Other symbols will also become familiar when we study the corresponding language features.

## Summary

`Symbol` is a primitive type for unique identifiers.

Symbols are created with `Symbol()` call with an optional description (name).

Symbols are always different values, even if they have the same name. If we want same-named symbols to be equal, then we should use the global registry: `Symbol.for(key)` returns (creates if needed) a global symbol with `key` as the name. Multiple calls of `Symbol.for` with the same `key` return exactly the same symbol.

Symbols have two main use cases:

1. "Hidden" object properties.
    If we want to add a property into an object that "belongs" to another script or a library, we can create a symbol and use it as a property key. A symbolic property does not appear in `for..in`, so it won't be accidentally processed together with other properties. Also it won't be accessed directly, because another script does not have our symbol. So the property will be protected from accidental use or overwrite.

    So we can "covertly" hide something into objects that we need, but others should not see, using symbolic properties.

2. There are many system symbols used by JavaScript which are accessible as `Symbol.*`. We can use them to alter some built-in behaviors. For instance, later in the tutorial we'll use `Symbol.iterator` for [iterables](info:iterable), `Symbol.toPrimitive` to setup [object-to-primitive conversion](info:object-toprimitive) and so on.

Technically, symbols are not 100% hidden. There is a built-in method [Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(obj)](mdn:js/Object/getOwnPropertySymbols) that allows us to get all symbols. Also there is a method named [Reflect.ownKeys(obj)](mdn:js/Reflect/ownKeys) that returns *all* keys of an object including symbolic ones. So they are not really hidden. But most libraries, built-in functions and syntax constructs don't use these methods.


# Object to primitive conversion

What happens when objects are added `obj1 + obj2`, subtracted `obj1 - obj2` or printed using `alert(obj)`?

JavaScript doesn't exactly allow to customize how operators work on objects. Unlike some other programming languages, such as Ruby or C++, we can't implement a special object method to handle an addition (or other operators).

In case of such operations, objects are auto-converted to primitives, and then the operation is carried out over these primitives and results in a primitive value.

That's an important limitation, as the result of `obj1 + obj2` can't be another object!

E.g. we can't make objects representing vectors or matrices (or achievements or whatever), add them and expect a "summed" object as the result. Such architectural feats are automatically "off the board".

So, because we can't do much here, there's no maths with objects in real projects. When it happens, it's usually because of a coding mistake.

In this chapter we'll cover how an object converts to primitive and how to customize it.

We have two purposes:

1. It will allow us to understand what's going on in case of coding mistakes, when such an operation happened accidentally.
2. There are exceptions, where such operations are possible and look good. E.g. subtracting or comparing dates (`Date` objects). We'll come across them later.

## Conversion rules

In the chapter <info:type-conversions> we've seen the rules for numeric, string and boolean conversions of primitives. But we left a gap for objects. Now, as we know about methods and symbols it becomes possible to fill it.

1. All objects are `true` in a boolean context. There are only numeric and string conversions.
2. The numeric conversion happens when we subtract objects or apply mathematical functions. For instance, `Date` objects (to be covered in the chapter <info:date>) can be subtracted, and the result of `date1 - date2` is the time difference between two dates.
3. As for the string conversion -- it usually happens when we output an object like `alert(obj)` and in similar contexts.

We can fine-tune string and numeric conversion, using special object methods.

There are three variants of type conversion, that happen in various situations.

They're called "hints", as described in the [specification](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-toprimitive):

`"string"`
: For an object-to-string conversion, when we're doing an operation on an object that expects a string, like `alert`:

    ```js
    // output
    alert(obj);

    // using object as a property key
    anotherObj[obj] = 123;
    ```

`"number"`
: For an object-to-number conversion, like when we're doing maths:

    ```js
    // explicit conversion
    let num = Number(obj);

    // maths (except binary plus)
    let n = +obj; // unary plus
    let delta = date1 - date2;

    // less/greater comparison
    let greater = user1 > user2;
    ```

`"default"`
: Occurs in rare cases when the operator is "not sure" what type to expect.

    For instance, binary plus `+` can work both with strings (concatenates them) and numbers (adds them), so both strings and numbers would do. So if a binary plus gets an object as an argument, it uses the `"default"` hint to convert it.

    Also, if an object is compared using `==` with a string, number or a symbol, it's also unclear which conversion should be done, so the `"default"` hint is used.

    ```js
    // binary plus uses the "default" hint
    let total = obj1 + obj2;

    // obj == number uses the "default" hint
    if (user == 1) { ... };
    ```

    The greater and less comparison operators, such as `<` `>`, can work with both strings and numbers too. Still, they use the `"number"` hint, not `"default"`. That's for historical reasons.

    In practice though, we don't need to remember these peculiar details, because all built-in objects except for one case (`Date` object, we'll learn it later) implement `"default"` conversion the same way as `"number"`. And we can do the same.

```smart header="No `\"boolean\"` hint"
Please note -- there are only three hints. It's that simple.

There is no "boolean" hint (all objects are `true` in boolean context) or anything else. And if we treat `"default"` and `"number"` the same, like most built-ins do, then there are only two conversions.
```

**To do the conversion, JavaScript tries to find and call three object methods:**

1. Call `obj[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint)` - the method with the symbolic key `Symbol.toPrimitive` (system symbol), if such method exists,
2. Otherwise if hint is `"string"`
    - try `obj.toString()` and `obj.valueOf()`, whatever exists.
3. Otherwise if hint is `"number"` or `"default"`
    - try `obj.valueOf()` and `obj.toString()`, whatever exists.

## Symbol.toPrimitive

Let's start from the first method. There's a built-in symbol named `Symbol.toPrimitive` that should be used to name the conversion method, like this:

```js
obj[Symbol.toPrimitive] = function(hint) {
  // here goes the code to convert this object to a primitive
  // it must return a primitive value
  // hint = one of "string", "number", "default"
};
```

If the method `Symbol.toPrimitive` exists, it's used for all hints, and no more methods are needed.

For instance, here `user` object implements it:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  money: 1000,

  [Symbol.toPrimitive](hint) {
    alert(`hint: ${hint}`);
    return hint == "string" ? `{name: "${this.name}"}` : this.money;
  }
};

// conversions demo:
alert(user); // hint: string -> {name: "John"}
alert(+user); // hint: number -> 1000
alert(user + 500); // hint: default -> 1500
```

As we can see from the code, `user` becomes a self-descriptive string or a money amount depending on the conversion. The single method `user[Symbol.toPrimitive]` handles all conversion cases.


## toString/valueOf

If there's no `Symbol.toPrimitive` then JavaScript tries to find methods `toString` and `valueOf`:

- For the "string" hint: `toString`, and if it doesn't exist, then `valueOf` (so `toString` has the priority for string conversions).
- For other hints: `valueOf`, and if it doesn't exist, then `toString` (so `valueOf` has the priority for maths).

Methods `toString` and `valueOf` come from ancient times. They are not symbols (symbols did not exist that long ago), but rather "regular" string-named methods. They provide an alternative "old-style" way to implement the conversion.

These methods must return a primitive value. If `toString` or `valueOf` returns an object, then it's ignored (same as if there were no method).

By default, a plain object has following `toString` and `valueOf` methods:

- The `toString` method returns a string `"[object Object]"`.
- The `valueOf` method returns the object itself.

Here's the demo:

```js run
let user = {name: "John"};

alert(user); // [object Object]
alert(user.valueOf() === user); // true
```

So if we try to use an object as a string, like in an `alert` or so, then by default we see `[object Object]`.

The default `valueOf` is mentioned here only for the sake of completeness, to avoid any confusion. As you can see, it returns the object itself, and so is ignored. Don't ask me why, that's for historical reasons. So we can assume it doesn't exist.

Let's implement these methods to customize the conversion.

For instance, here `user` does the same as above using a combination of `toString` and `valueOf` instead of `Symbol.toPrimitive`:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  money: 1000,

  // for hint="string"
  toString() {
    return `{name: "${this.name}"}`;
  },

  // for hint="number" or "default"
  valueOf() {
    return this.money;
  }

};

alert(user); // toString -> {name: "John"}
alert(+user); // valueOf -> 1000
alert(user + 500); // valueOf -> 1500
```

As we can see, the behavior is the same as the previous example with `Symbol.toPrimitive`.

Often we want a single "catch-all" place to handle all primitive conversions. In this case, we can implement `toString` only, like this:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",

  toString() {
    return this.name;
  }
};

alert(user); // toString -> John
alert(user + 500); // toString -> John500
```

In the absence of `Symbol.toPrimitive` and `valueOf`, `toString` will handle all primitive conversions.

### A conversion can return any primitive type

The important thing to know about all primitive-conversion methods is that they do not necessarily return the "hinted" primitive.

There is no control whether `toString` returns exactly a string, or whether `Symbol.toPrimitive` method returns a number for a hint `"number"`.

The only mandatory thing: these methods must return a primitive, not an object.

```smart header="Historical notes"
For historical reasons, if `toString` or `valueOf` returns an object, there's no error, but such value is ignored (like if the method didn't exist). That's because in ancient times there was no good "error" concept in JavaScript.

In contrast, `Symbol.toPrimitive` *must* return a primitive, otherwise there will be an error.
```

## Further conversions

As we know already, many operators and functions perform type conversions, e.g. multiplication `*` converts operands to numbers.

If we pass an object as an argument, then there are two stages:
1. The object is converted to a primitive (using the rules described above).
2. If the resulting primitive isn't of the right type, it's converted.

For instance:

```js run
let obj = {
  // toString handles all conversions in the absence of other methods
  toString() {
    return "2";
  }
};

alert(obj * 2); // 4, object converted to primitive "2", then multiplication made it a number
```

1. The multiplication `obj * 2` first converts the object to primitive (that's a string `"2"`).
2. Then `"2" * 2` becomes `2 * 2` (the string is converted to number).

Binary plus will concatenate strings in the same situation, as it gladly accepts a string:

```js run
let obj = {
  toString() {
    return "2";
  }
};

alert(obj + 2); // 22 ("2" + 2), conversion to primitive returned a string => concatenation
```

## Summary

The object-to-primitive conversion is called automatically by many built-in functions and operators that expect a primitive as a value.

There are 3 types (hints) of it:
- `"string"` (for `alert` and other operations that need a string)
- `"number"` (for maths)
- `"default"` (few operators)

The specification describes explicitly which operator uses which hint. There are very few operators that "don't know what to expect" and use the `"default"` hint. Usually for built-in objects `"default"` hint is handled the same way as `"number"`, so in practice the last two are often merged together.

The conversion algorithm is:

1. Call `obj[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint)` if the method exists,
2. Otherwise if hint is `"string"`
    - try `obj.toString()` and `obj.valueOf()`, whatever exists.
3. Otherwise if hint is `"number"` or `"default"`
    - try `obj.valueOf()` and `obj.toString()`, whatever exists.

In practice, it's often enough to implement only `obj.toString()` as a "catch-all" method for string conversions that should return a "human-readable" representation of an object, for logging or debugging purposes.  

As for math operations, JavaScript doesn't provide a way to "override" them using methods, so real life projects rarely use them on objects.
