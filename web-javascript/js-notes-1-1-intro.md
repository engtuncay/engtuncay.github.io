## Introduction

**A 30DaysOfJavaScript** challenge is a guide for both beginners and advanced JavaScript developers. Welcome to JavaScript. JavaScript is the language of the web. I enjoy using and teaching JavaScript and I hope you will do so too.

In this step by step JavaScript challenge, you will learn JavaScript, the most popular programming language in the history of mankind.
JavaScript is used **_to add interactivity to websites, to develop mobile apps, desktop applications, games_** and nowadays JavaScript can be used for **server-side programming**,  **_machine learning_** and **_AI_**.

**_JavaScript (JS)_** has increased in popularity in recent years and has been the leading
programming language for last ten years and is the most used programming language on
GitHub.

This challenge is easy to read, written in conversational English, engaging, motivating and at the same time, it is very demanding. You need to allocate much time to finish this challenge. If you are a visual learner, you may get the video lesson on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7PNRuno1rzYPb1xLa4yktw"> Washera</a> YouTube channel. Subscribe the channel, comment and ask questions on YouTube vides and be proactive, the author will eventually notice you. 

The author likes to hear your opinion about the challenge, share the author by expressing your thoughts about the 30DaysOfJavaScript challenge. You can leave your testimonial on this [link](https://testimonial-vdzd.onrender.com//)

## Requirements

No prior knowledge of programming is required to follow this challenge. You need only:

1. Motivation
2. A computer
3. Internet
4. A browser
5. A code editor

## Setup

I believe you have the motivation and a strong desire to be a developer, a computer and Internet. If you have those, then you have everything to get started.

### Install Node.js

You may not need Node.js right now but you may need it for later. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

![Node download](images/download_node.png)

After downloading double click and install

![Install node](images/install_node.png)

We can check if node is installed on our local machine by opening our device terminal or command prompt.

```sh
asabeneh $ node -v
v12.14.0
```

When making this tutorial I was using Node version 12.14.0, but now the recommended version of Node.js for download is v14.17.6, by the time you use this material you may have a higher Node.js version.

### Browser

There are many browsers out there. However, I strongly recommend Google Chrome.

#### Installing Google Chrome

Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) if you do not have one yet. We can write small JavaScript code on the browser console, but we do not use the browser console to develop applications.

![Google Chrome](images/google_chrome.png)

#### Opening Google Chrome Console

You can open Google Chrome console either by clicking three dots at the top right corner of the browser, selecting _More tools -> Developer tools_ or using a keyboard shortcut. I prefer using shortcuts.

![Opening chrome](images/opening_developer_tool.png)

To open the Chrome console using a keyboard shortcut.

```sh
Mac
Command+Option+J

Windows/Linux:
Ctl+Shift+J
```

![Opening console](images/opening_chrome_console_shortcut.png)

After you open the Google Chrome console, try to explore the marked buttons. We will spend most of the time on the Console. The Console is the place where your JavaScript code goes. The Google Console V8 engine changes your JavaScript code to machine code.
Let us write a JavaScript code on the Google Chrome console:

![write code on console](./images/js_code_on_chrome_console.png)

#### Writing Code on Browser Console

We can write any JavaScript code on the Google console or any browser console. However, for this challenge, we only focus on Google Chrome console. Open the console using:

```sh
Mac
Command+Option+I

Windows:
Ctl+Shift+I
```

##### Console.log

To write our first JavaScript code, we used a built-in function **console.log()**. We passed an argument as input data, and the function displays the output. We passed `'Hello, World'` as input data or argument in the console.log() function.

```js
console.log('Hello, World!')
```

##### Console.log with Multiple Arguments

The **`console.log()`** function can take multiple parameters separated by commas. The syntax looks like as follows:**`console.log(param1, param2, param3)`**

![console log multiple arguments](./images/console_log_multipl_arguments.png)

```js
console.log('Hello', 'World', '!')
console.log('HAPPY', 'NEW', 'YEAR', 2020)
console.log('Welcome', 'to', 30, 'Days', 'Of', 'JavaScript')
```

As you can see from the snippet code above, _`console.log()`_ can take multiple arguments.

Congratulations! You wrote your first JavaScript code using _`console.log()`_.

##### Comments

We can add comments to our code. Comments are very important to make code more readable and to leave remarks in our code. JavaScript does not execute the comment part of our code. In JavaScript, any text line starting with // in JavaScript is a comment, and anything enclosed like this `//` is also a comment.

**Example: Single Line Comment**

```js
// This is the first comment  
// This is the second comment  
// I am a single line comment
```

**Example: Multiline Comment**

```js
/*
This is a multiline comment  
 Multiline comments can take multiple lines  
 JavaScript is the language of the web  
 */
```

##### Syntax

Programming languages are similar to human languages. English or many other language uses words, phrases, sentences, compound sentences and other more to convey a meaningful message. The English meaning of syntax is _the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language_. The technical definition of syntax is the structure of statements in a computer language. Programming languages have syntax. JavaScript is a programming language and like other programming languages it has its own syntax. If we do not write a syntax that JavaScript understands, it will raise different types of errors. We will explore different kinds of JavaScript errors later. For now, let us see syntax errors.

![Error](images/raising_syntax_error.png)

I made a deliberate mistake. As a result, the console raises syntax errors. Actually, the syntax is very informative. It informs what type of mistake was made. By reading the error feedback guideline, we can correct the syntax and fix the problem. The process of identifying and removing errors from a program is called debugging. Let us fix the errors:

```js
console.log('Hello, World!')
console.log('Hello, World!')
```

So far, we saw how to display text using the _`console.log()`_. If we are printing text or string using _`console.log()`_, the text has to be inside the single quotes, double quotes, or a backtick.
**Example:**

```js
console.log('Hello, World!')
console.log("Hello, World!")
console.log(`Hello, World!`)
```

#### Arithmetics

Now, let us practice more writing JavaScript codes using _`console.log()`_ on Google Chrome console for number data types.
In addition to the text, we can also do mathematical calculations using JavaScript. Let us do the following simple calculations.
It is possible to write JavaScript code on Google Chrome console can directly without the **_`console.log()`_** function. However, it is included in this introduction because most of this challenge would be taking place in a text editor where the usage of the function would be mandatory. You can play around directly with instructions on the console.

![Arithmetic](images/arithmetic.png)

```js
console.log(2 + 3) // Addition
console.log(3 - 2) // Subtraction
console.log(2 * 3) // Multiplication
console.log(3 / 2) // Division
console.log(3 % 2) // Modulus - finding remainder
console.log(3 ** 2) // Exponentiation 3 ** 2 == 3 * 3
```

### Code Editor

We can write our codes on the browser console, but it won't be for bigger projects. In a real working environment, developers use different code editors to write their codes. In this 30 days of JavaScript challenge, we will be using Visual Studio Code.

#### Installing Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a very popular open-source text editor. I would recommend to [download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but if you are in favor of other editors, feel free to follow with what you have.

![Vscode](images/vscode.png)

If you installed Visual Studio Code, let us start using it.

#### How to Use Visual Studio Code

Open the Visual Studio Code by double-clicking its icon. When you open it, you will get this kind of interface. Try to interact with the labeled icons.

## Adding JavaScript to a Web Page

JavaScript can be added to a web page in three different ways:

- **_Inline script_**
- **_Internal script_**
- **_External script_**
- **_Multiple External scripts_**

The following sections show different ways of adding JavaScript code to your web page.

### Inline Script

Create a project folder on your desktop or in any location, name it 30DaysOfJS and create an **_`index.html`_** file in the project folder. Then paste the following code and open it in a browser, for example [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>30DaysOfScript:Inline Script</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button onclick="alert('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript!')">Click Me</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now, you just wrote your first inline script. We can create a pop up alert message using the _`alert()`_ built-in function.

### Internal Script

The internal script can be written in the _`head`_ or the _`body`_, but it is preferred to put it on the body of the HTML document.
First, let us write on the head part of the page.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>30DaysOfScript:Internal Script</title>
    <script>
      console.log('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript')
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

This is how we write an internal script most of the time. Writing the JavaScript code in the body section is the most preferred option. Open the browser console to see the output from the `console.log()`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>30DaysOfScript:Internal Script</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button onclick="alert('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript!');">Click Me</button>
    <script>
      console.log('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript')
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Open the browser console to see the output from the `console.log()`.

![js code from vscode](./images/js_code_vscode.png)

### External Script

Similar to the internal script, the external script link can be on the header or body, but it is preferred to put it in the body.
First, we should create an external JavaScript file with .js extension. All files ending with .js extension are JavaScript files. Create a file named introduction.js inside your project directory and write the following code and link this .js file at the bottom of the body.

```js
console.log('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript')
```

External scripts in the _head_:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>30DaysOfJavaScript:External script</title>
    <script src="introduction.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

External scripts in the _body_:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>30DaysOfJavaScript:External script</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- JavaScript external link could be in the header or in the body --> 
    <!-- Before the closing tag of the body is the recommended place to put the external JavaScript script -->
    <script src="introduction.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Open the browser console to see the output of the `console.log()`.

### Multiple External Scripts

We can also link multiple external JavaScript files to a web page.
Create a `helloworld.js` file inside the 30DaysOfJS folder and write the following code.

```js
console.log('Hello, World!')
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Multiple External Scripts</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="./helloworld.js"></script>
    <script src="./introduction.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

_Your main.js file should be below all other scripts_. It is very important to remember this.

![Multiple Script](./images/multiple_script.png)

## Introduction to Data types

In JavaScript and also other programming languages, there are different types of data types. The following are JavaScript primitive data types: _String, Number, Boolean, undefined, Null_, and _Symbol_.

### Numbers

- Integers: Integer (negative, zero and positive) numbers
  Example:
  ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ...
- Float-point numbers: Decimal number
  Example
  ... -3.5, -2.25, -1.0, 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.5 ...

### Strings

A collection of one or more characters between two single quotes, double quotes, or backticks.

**Example:**

```js
'a'
'Asabeneh'
"Asabeneh"
'Finland'
'JavaScript is a beautiful programming language'
'I love teaching'
'I hope you are enjoying the first day'
`We can also create a string using a backtick`
'A string could be just as small as one character or as big as many pages'
'Any data type under a single quote, double quote or backtick is a string'
```

### Booleans

A boolean value is either True or False. Any comparisons returns a boolean value, which is either true or false.

A boolean data type is either a true or false value.

**Example:**

```js
true // if the light is on, the value is true
false // if the light is off, the value is false
```

### Undefined

In JavaScript, if we don't assign a value to a variable, the value is undefined. In addition to that, if a function is not returning anything, it returns undefined.

```js
let firstName
console.log(firstName) // undefined, because it is not assigned to a value yet
```

### Null

Null in JavaScript means an empty value.

```js
let emptyValue = null
```

## Checking Data Types

To check the data type of a certain variable, we use the **typeof** operator. See the following example.

```js
console.log(typeof 'Asabeneh') // string
console.log(typeof 5) // number
console.log(typeof true) // boolean
console.log(typeof null) // object type
console.log(typeof undefined) // undefined
```

## Comments Again

Remember that commenting in JavaScript is similar to other programming languages. Comments are important in making your code more readable.
There are two ways of commenting:

- _Single line commenting_
- _Multiline commenting_

```js
// commenting the code itself with a single comment
// let firstName = 'Asabeneh'; single line comment
// let lastName = 'Yetayeh'; single line comment
```

Multiline commenting:

```js
/*
  let location = 'Helsinki';
  let age = 100;
  let isMarried = true;
  This is a Multiple line comment
*/
```

## Variables

Variables are _containers_ of data. Variables are used to _store_ data in a memory location. When a variable is declared, a memory location is reserved. When a variable is assigned to a value (data), the memory space will be filled with that data. To declare a variable, we use _var_, _let_, or _const_ keywords.

For a variable that changes at a different time, we use _let_. If the data does not change at all, we use _const_. For example, PI, country name, gravity do not change, and we can use _const_. We will not use var in this challenge and I don't recommend you to use it. It is error prone way of declaring variable it has lots of leak. We will talk more about var, let, and const in detail in other sections (scope). For now, the above explanation is enough.

A valid JavaScript variable name must follow the following rules:

- A JavaScript variable name should not begin with a number.
- A JavaScript variable name does not allow special characters except dollar sign and underscore.
- A JavaScript variable name follows a camelCase convention.
- A JavaScript variable name should not have space between words.

The following are examples of valid JavaScript variables.

```js
firstName
lastName
country
city
capitalCity
age
isMarried

first_name
last_name
is_married
capital_city

num1
num_1
_num_1
$num1
year2020
year_2020
```

The first and second variables on the list follows the camelCase convention of declaring in JavaScript. In this material, we will use camelCase variables(camelWithOneHump). We use CamelCase(CamelWithTwoHump) to declare classes, we will discuss about classes and objects in other section.

Example of invalid variables:

```js
  first-name
  1_num
  num_#_1
```

Let us declare variables with different data types. To declare a variable, we need to use _let_ or _const_ keyword before the variable name. Following the variable name, we write an equal sign (assignment operator), and a value(assigned data).

```js
// Syntax
let nameOfVariable = value
```

The nameOfVriable is the name that stores different data of value. See below for detail examples.

**Examples of declared variables**

```js
// Declaring different variables of different data types
let firstName = 'Asabeneh' // first name of a person
let lastName = 'Yetayeh' // last name of a person
let country = 'Finland' // country
let city = 'Helsinki' // capital city
let age = 100 // age in years
let isMarried = true

console.log(firstName, lastName, country, city, age, isMarried)
```

```sh
Asabeneh Yetayeh Finland Helsinki 100 true
```

```js
// Declaring variables with number values
let age = 100 // age in years
const gravity = 9.81 // earth gravity  in m/s2
const boilingPoint = 100 // water boiling point, temperature in °C
const PI = 3.14 // geometrical constant
console.log(gravity, boilingPoint, PI)
```

```sh
9.81 100 3.14
```

```js
// Variables can also be declaring in one line separated by comma, however I recommend to use a seperate line to make code more readble
let name = 'Asabeneh', job = 'teacher', live = 'Finland'
console.log(name, job, live)
```

```sh
Asabeneh teacher Finland
```

# Section - Scope

## Scope 

To declare a variable we use the key word _var_, _let_ and _const_. 

Variables scopes can be:

- Global
- Local

Variable can be declared globally or locally scope. Anything declared without let, var or const is scoped at global level.

### Window Global Object

Without using console.log() open your browser and check, you will see the value of a and b if you write a or b on the browser. That means a and b are already available in the window.

```js
//file:scope.js
a = 'JavaScript' // declaring a variable without let or const make it available in window object and this found anywhere
b = 10 // this is a global scope variable and found in the window object
function letsLearnScope() {
  console.log(a, b)
  if (true) {
    console.log(a, b)
  }
}
console.log(a, b) // accessible
```

### Global scope

A globally declared variable can be accessed every where in the same file. But the term global is relative. It can be global to the file or it can be global relative to some block of codes.

```js
//scope.js
let a = 'JavaScript' // is a global scope it will be found anywhere in this file
let b = 10 // is a global scope it will be found anywhere in this file
function letsLearnScope() {
  console.log(a, b) // JavaScript 10, accessible
  if (true) {
    let a = 'Python'
    let b = 100
    console.log(a, b) // Python 100
  }
  console.log(a, b)
}
letsLearnScope()
console.log(a, b) // JavaScript 10, accessible
```

### Local scope

A variable declared as local can be accessed only in certain block code.

- Block Scope
- Function Scope

```js
//scope.js
let a = 'JavaScript' // is a global scope it will be found anywhere in this file
let b = 10 // is a global scope it will be found anywhere in this file
// Function scope
function letsLearnScope() {
  console.log(a, b) // JavaScript 10, accessible
  let value = false
  // block scope
  if (true) {
    // we can access from the function and outside the function but 
    // variables declared inside the if will not be accessed outside the if block
    let a = 'Python'
    let b = 20
    let c = 30
    let d = 40
    value = !value
    console.log(a, b, c, value) // Python 20 30 true
  }
  // we can not access c because c's scope is only the if block
  console.log(a, b, value) // JavaScript 10 true
}
letsLearnScope()
console.log(a, b) // JavaScript 10, accessible
```

Now, you have an understanding of scope. A variable declared with *var* only scoped to function but variable declared with *let* or *const* is block scope(function block, if block, loop block, etc). Block in JavaScript is a code in between two curly brackets ({}).

```js
//scope.js
function letsLearnScope() {
  var gravity = 9.81
  console.log(gravity)

}
// console.log(gravity), Uncaught ReferenceError: gravity is not defined

if (true){
  var gravity = 9.81
  console.log(gravity) // 9.81
}
console.log(gravity)  // 9.81

for(var i = 0; i < 3; i++){
  console.log(i) // 0, 1, 2
}
console.log(i) // 3

```

In ES6 and above there is *let* and *const*, so you will not suffer from the sneakiness of *var*. When we use *let* our variable is block scoped and it will not infect other parts of our code.

```js
//scope.js
function letsLearnScope() {
  // you can use let or const, but gravity is constant I prefer to use const
  const gravity = 9.81
  console.log(gravity)

}
// console.log(gravity), Uncaught ReferenceError: gravity is not defined

if (true){
  const gravity = 9.81
  console.log(gravity) // 9.81
}
// console.log(gravity), Uncaught ReferenceError: gravity is not defined

for(let i = 0; i < 3; i++){
  console.log(i) // 0, 1, 2
}
// console.log(i), Uncaught ReferenceError: i is not defined

```

The scope *let* and *const* are the same. The difference is only reassigning. We can not change or reassign the value of the `const` variable. 

I would strongly suggest you to use *let* and *const*, by using *let* and *const* you will write clean code and avoid hard to debug mistakes. As a rule of thumb, you can use *let* for any value which change, *const* for any constant value, and for an array, object, arrow function and function expression.
