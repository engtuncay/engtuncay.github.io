# Variables

Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. Here are two examples:
1. An online shop -- the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.
2. A chat application -- the information might include users, messages, and much more.

Variables are used to store this information.

## A variable

A [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)) is a "named storage" for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

To create a variable in JavaScript, use the `let` keyword.

The statement below creates (in other words: *declares*) a variable with the name "message":

```js
let message;
```

Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator `=`:

```js
let message;

*!*
message = 'Hello'; // store the string
*/!*
```

The string is now saved into the memory area associated with the variable. We can access it using the variable name:

```js run
let message;
message = 'Hello!';

*!*
alert(message); // shows the variable content
*/!*
```

To be concise, we can combine the variable declaration and assignment into a single line:

```js run
let message = 'Hello!'; // define the variable and assign the value

alert(message); // Hello!
```

We can also declare multiple variables in one line:

```js no-beautify
let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';
```

That might seem shorter, but we don't recommend it. For the sake of better readability, please use a single line per variable.

The multiline variant is a bit longer, but easier to read:

```js
let user = 'John';
let age = 25;
let message = 'Hello';
```

Some people also define multiple variables in this multiline style:
```js no-beautify
let user = 'John',
  age = 25,
  message = 'Hello';
```

...Or even in the "comma-first" style:

```js no-beautify
let user = 'John'
  , age = 25
  , message = 'Hello';
```

Technically, all these variants do the same thing. So, it's a matter of personal taste and aesthetics.

**`var` instead of `let`**
In older scripts, you may also find another keyword: `var` instead of `let`:

```js
var message = 'Hello';
```

The `var` keyword is *almost* the same as `let`. It also declares a variable, but in a slightly different, "old-school" way.

There are subtle differences between `let` and `var`, but they do not matter for us yet. We'll cover them in detail in the chapter [info:var]().


## A real-life analogy

We can easily grasp the concept of a "variable" if we imagine it as a "box" for data, with a uniquely-named sticker on it.

For instance, the variable `message` can be imagined as a box labeled `"message"` with the value `"Hello!"` in it:

![](variable.svg)

We can put any value in the box.

We can also change it as many times as we want:

```js run
let message;

message = 'Hello!';

message = 'World!'; // value changed

alert(message);
```

When the value is changed, the old data is removed from the variable:

![](variable-change.svg)

We can also declare two variables and copy data from one into the other.

```js run
let hello = 'Hello world!';

let message;

*!*
// copy 'Hello world' from hello into message
message = hello;
*/!*

// now two variables hold the same data
alert(hello); // Hello world!
alert(message); // Hello world!
```

**Warn : Declaring twice triggers an error**
A variable should be declared only once.

A repeated declaration of the same variable is an error:

```js run
let message = "This";

// repeated 'let' leads to an error
let message = "That"; // SyntaxError: 'message' has already been declared
```
So, we should declare a variable once and then refer to it without `let`.

**Smart : Functional languages**

It's interesting to note that there exist [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) programming languages, like [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) or [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) that forbid changing variable values.

In such languages, once the value is stored "in the box", it's there forever. If we need to store something else, the language forces us to create a new box (declare a new variable). We can't reuse the old one.

Though it may seem a little odd at first sight, these languages are quite capable of serious development. More than that, there are areas like parallel computations where this limitation confers certain benefits. Studying such a language (even if you're not planning to use it soon) is recommended to broaden the mind.

## Variable naming

There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:

1. The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols `$` and `_`.
2. The first character must not be a digit.

Examples of valid names:

```js
let userName;
let test123;
```

When the name contains multiple words, [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) is commonly used. That is: words go one after another, each word except first starting with a capital letter: `myVeryLongName`.

What's interesting -- the dollar sign `'$'` and the underscore `'_'` can also be used in names. They are regular symbols, just like letters, without any special meaning.

These names are valid:

```js run untrusted
let $ = 1; // declared a variable with the name "$"
let _ = 2; // and now a variable with the name "_"

alert($ + _); // 3
```

Examples of incorrect variable names:

```js no-beautify
let 1a; // cannot start with a digit

let my-name; // hyphens '-' aren't allowed in the name
```

**smart : Case matters**

Variables named `apple` and `AppLE` are two different variables.


**smart : Non-Latin letters are allowed, but not recommended**

It is possible to use any language, including cyrillic letters or even hieroglyphs, like this:

```js
let имя = '...';
let 我 = '...';
```

Technically, there is no error here. Such names are allowed, but there is an international convention to use English in variable names. Even if we're writing a small script, it may have a long life ahead. People from other countries may need to read it some time.


**Warn : "Reserved names"**
There is a [list of reserved words](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords), which cannot be used as variable names because they are used by the language itself.

For example: `let`, `class`, `return`, and `function` are reserved.

The code below gives a syntax error:

```js run no-beautify
let let = 5; // can't name a variable "let", error!
let return = 5; // also can't name it "return", error!
```

**Warn : "An assignment without `use strict`"**

Normally, we need to define a variable before using it. But in the old times, it was technically possible to create a variable by a mere assignment of the value without using `let`. This still works now if we don't put `use strict` in our scripts to maintain compatibility with old scripts.

```js run no-strict
// note: no "use strict" in this example

num = 5; // the variable "num" is created if it didn't exist

alert(num); // 5
```

This is a bad practice and would cause an error in strict mode:

```js
"use strict";

*!*
num = 5; // error: num is not defined
*/!*
```


## Constants

To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use `const` instead of `let`:

```js
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';
```

Variables declared using `const` are called "constants". They cannot be reassigned. An attempt to do so would cause an error:

```js run
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';

myBirthday = '01.01.2001'; // error, can't reassign the constant!
```

When a programmer is sure that a variable will never change, they can declare it with `const` to guarantee and clearly communicate that fact to everyone.


### Uppercase constants

There is a widespread practice to use constants as aliases for difficult-to-remember values that are known prior to execution.

Such constants are named using capital letters and underscores.

For instance, let's make constants for colors in so-called "web" (hexadecimal) format:

```js run
const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
const COLOR_GREEN = "#0F0";
const COLOR_BLUE = "#00F";
const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";

// ...when we need to pick a color
let color = COLOR_ORANGE;
alert(color); // #FF7F00
```

Benefits:

- `COLOR_ORANGE` is much easier to remember than `"#FF7F00"`.
- It is much easier to mistype `"#FF7F00"` than `COLOR_ORANGE`.
- When reading the code, `COLOR_ORANGE` is much more meaningful than `#FF7F00`.

When should we use capitals for a constant and when should we name it normally? Let's make that clear.

Being a "constant" just means that a variable's value never changes. But there are constants that are known prior to execution (like a hexadecimal value for red) and there are constants that are *calculated* in run-time, during the execution, but do not change after their initial assignment.

For instance:
```js
const pageLoadTime = /* time taken by a webpage to load */;
```

The value of `pageLoadTime` is not known prior to the page load, so it's named normally. But it's still a constant because it doesn't change after assignment.

In other words, capital-named constants are only used as aliases for "hard-coded" values.  

## Name things right

Talking about variables, there's one more extremely important thing.

A variable name should have a clean, obvious meaning, describing the data that it stores.

Variable naming is one of the most important and complex skills in programming. A quick glance at variable names can reveal which code was written by a beginner versus an experienced developer.

In a real project, most of the time is spent modifying and extending an existing code base rather than writing something completely separate from scratch. When we return to some code after doing something else for a while, it's much easier to find information that is well-labeled. Or, in other words, when the variables have good names.

Please spend time thinking about the right name for a variable before declaring it. Doing so will repay you handsomely.

Some good-to-follow rules are:

- Use human-readable names like `userName` or `shoppingCart`.
- Stay away from abbreviations or short names like `a`, `b`, `c`, unless you really know what you're doing.
- Make names maximally descriptive and concise. Examples of bad names are `data` and `value`. Such names say nothing. It's only okay to use them if the context of the code makes it exceptionally obvious which data or value the variable is referencing.
- Agree on terms within your team and in your own mind. If a site visitor is called a "user" then we should name related variables `currentUser` or `newUser` instead of `currentVisitor` or `newManInTown`.

Sounds simple? Indeed it is, but creating descriptive and concise variable names in practice is not. Go for it.

```smart header="Reuse or create?"
And the last note. There are some lazy programmers who, instead of declaring new variables, tend to reuse existing ones.

As a result, their variables are like boxes into which people throw different things without changing their stickers. What's inside the box now? Who knows? We need to come closer and check.

Such programmers save a little bit on variable declaration but lose ten times more on debugging.

An extra variable is good, not evil.

Modern JavaScript minifiers and browsers optimize code well enough, so it won't create performance issues. Using different variables for different values can even help the engine optimize your code.
```

## Summary

We can declare variables to store data by using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.

- `let` -- is a modern variable declaration.
- `var` -- is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don't use it at all, but we'll cover subtle differences from `let` in the chapter <info:var>, just in case you need them.
- `const` -- is like `let`, but the value of the variable can't be changed.

Variables should be named in a way that allows us to easily understand what's inside them.

# Data types

A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a string or a number.

There are eight basic data types in JavaScript. Here, we'll cover them in general and in the next chapters we'll talk about each of them in detail.

We can put any type in a variable. For example, a variable can at one moment be a string and then store a number:

```js
// no error
let message = "hello";
message = 123456;
```

Programming languages that allow such things, such as JavaScript, are called "dynamically typed", meaning that there exist data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.

## Number

```js
let n = 123;
n = 12.345;
```

The *number* type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication `*`, division `/`, addition `+`, subtraction `-`, and so on.

Besides regular numbers, there are so-called "special numeric values" which also belong to this data type: `Infinity`, `-Infinity` and `NaN`.

- `Infinity` represents the mathematical [Infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity) ∞. It is a special value that's greater than any number.

    We can get it as a result of division by zero:

    ```js run
    alert( 1 / 0 ); // Infinity
    ```

    Or just reference it directly:

    ```js run
    alert( Infinity ); // Infinity
    ```
- `NaN` represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation, for instance:

    ```js run
    alert( "not a number" / 2 ); // NaN, such division is erroneous
    ```

    `NaN` is sticky. Any further operation on `NaN` returns `NaN`:

    ```js run
    alert( "not a number" / 2 + 5 ); // NaN
    ```

    So, if there's a `NaN` somewhere in a mathematical expression, it propagates to the whole result.

```smart header="Mathematical operations are safe"
Doing maths is "safe" in JavaScript. We can do anything: divide by zero, treat non-numeric strings as numbers, etc.

The script will never stop with a fatal error ("die"). At worst, we'll get `NaN` as the result.
```

Special numeric values formally belong to the "number" type. Of course they are not numbers in the common sense of this word.

We'll see more about working with numbers in the chapter <info:number>.

## BigInt [#bigint-type]

In JavaScript, the "number" type cannot represent integer values larger than <code>(2<sup>53</sup>-1)</code> (that's `9007199254740991`), or less than <code>-(2<sup>53</sup>-1)</code> for negatives. It's a technical limitation caused by their internal representation.

For most purposes that's quite enough, but sometimes we need really big numbers, e.g. for cryptography or microsecond-precision timestamps.

`BigInt` type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.

A `BigInt` value is created by appending `n` to the end of an integer:

```js
// the "n" at the end means it's a BigInt
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
```

As `BigInt` numbers are rarely needed, we don't cover them here, but devoted them a separate chapter <info:bigint>. Read it when you need such big numbers.


```smart header="Compatibility issues"
Right now, `BigInt` is supported in Firefox/Chrome/Edge/Safari, but not in IE.
```

You can check [*MDN* BigInt compatibility table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt#Browser_compatibility) to know which versions of a browser are supported.

## String

A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.

```js
let str = "Hello";
let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';
let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`;
```

In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.

1. Double quotes: `"Hello"`.
2. Single quotes: `'Hello'`.
3. Backticks: <code>&#96;Hello&#96;</code>.

Double and single quotes are "simple" quotes. There's practically no difference between them in JavaScript.

Backticks are "extended functionality" quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in `${…}`, for example:

```js run
let name = "John";

// embed a variable
alert( `Hello, *!*${name}*/!*!` ); // Hello, John!

// embed an expression
alert( `the result is *!*${1 + 2}*/!*` ); // the result is 3
```

The expression inside `${…}` is evaluated and the result becomes a part of the string. We can put anything in there: a variable like `name` or an arithmetical expression like `1 + 2` or something more complex.

Please note that this can only be done in backticks. Other quotes don't have this embedding functionality!
```js run
alert( "the result is ${1 + 2}" ); // the result is ${1 + 2} (double quotes do nothing)
```

We'll cover strings more thoroughly in the chapter <info:string>.

```smart header="There is no *character* type."
In some languages, there is a special "character" type for a single character. For example, in the C language and in Java it is called "char".

In JavaScript, there is no such type. There's only one type: `string`. A string may consist of zero characters (be empty), one character or many of them.
```

## Boolean (logical type)

The boolean type has only two values: `true` and `false`.

This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: `true` means "yes, correct", and `false` means "no, incorrect".

For instance:

```js
let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked
let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked
```

Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons:

```js run
let isGreater = 4 > 1;

alert( isGreater ); // true (the comparison result is "yes")
```

We'll cover booleans more deeply in the chapter <info:logical-operators>.

## The "null" value

The special `null` value does not belong to any of the types described above.

It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the `null` value:

```js
let age = null;
```

In JavaScript, `null` is not a "reference to a non-existing object" or a "null pointer" like in some other languages.

It's just a special value which represents "nothing", "empty" or "value unknown".

The code above states that `age` is unknown.

## The "undefined" value

The special value `undefined` also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like `null`.

The meaning of `undefined` is "value is not assigned".

If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is `undefined`:

```js run
let age;

alert(age); // shows "undefined"
```

Technically, it is possible to explicitly assign `undefined` to a variable:

```js run
let age = 100;

// change the value to undefined
age = undefined;

alert(age); // "undefined"
```

...But we don't recommend doing that. Normally, one uses `null` to assign an "empty" or "unknown" value to a variable, while `undefined` is reserved as a default initial value for unassigned things.

## Objects and Symbols

The `object` type is special.

All other types are called "primitive" because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.

Being that important, objects deserve a special treatment. We'll deal with them later in the chapter <info:object>, after we learn more about primitives.

The `symbol` type is used to create unique identifiers for objects. We have to mention it here for the sake of completeness, but also postpone the details till we know objects.

## The typeof operator [#type-typeof]

The `typeof` operator returns the type of the argument. It's useful when we want to process values of different types differently or just want to do a quick check.

It supports two forms of syntax:

1. As an operator: `typeof x`.
2. As a function: `typeof(x)`.

In other words, it works with parentheses or without them. The result is the same.

The call to `typeof x` returns a string with the type name:

```js
typeof undefined // "undefined"

typeof 0 // "number"

typeof 10n // "bigint"

typeof true // "boolean"

typeof "foo" // "string"

typeof Symbol("id") // "symbol"

*!*
typeof Math // "object"  (1)
*/!*

*!*
typeof null // "object"  (2)
*/!*

*!*
typeof alert // "function"  (3)
*/!*
```

The last three lines may need additional explanation:

1. `Math` is a built-in object that provides mathematical operations. We will learn it in the chapter <info:number>. Here, it serves just as an example of an object.
2. The result of `typeof null` is `"object"`. That's an officially recognized error in `typeof` behavior, coming from the early days of JavaScript and kept for compatibility. Definitely, `null` is not an object. It is a special value with a separate type of its own.
3. The result of `typeof alert` is `"function"`, because `alert` is a function. We'll study functions in the next chapters where we'll also see that there's no special "function" type in JavaScript. Functions belong to the object type. But `typeof` treats them differently, returning `"function"`. That also comes from the early days of JavaScript. Technically, such behavior isn't correct, but can be convenient in practice.

## Summary

There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

- `number` for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by <code>±(2<sup>53</sup>-1)</code>.
- `bigint` is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
- `string` for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there's no separate single-character type.
- `boolean` for `true`/`false`.
- `null` for unknown values -- a standalone type that has a single value `null`.
- `undefined` for unassigned values -- a standalone type that has a single value `undefined`.
- `object` for more complex data structures.
- `symbol` for unique identifiers.

The `typeof` operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable.

- Two forms: `typeof x` or `typeof(x)`.
- Returns a string with the name of the type, like `"string"`.
- For `null` returns `"object"` -- this is an error in the language, it's not actually an object.

In the next chapters, we'll concentrate on primitive values and once we're familiar with them, we'll move on to objects.

# Type Conversions

Most of the time, operators and functions automatically convert the values given to them to the right type.

For example, `alert` automatically converts any value to a string to show it. Mathematical operations convert values to numbers.

There are also cases when we need to explicitly convert a value to the expected type.

```smart header="Not talking about objects yet"
In this chapter, we won't cover objects. For now we'll just be talking about primitives.

Later, after we learn about objects, in the chapter <info:object-toprimitive> we'll see how objects fit in.
```

## String Conversion

String conversion happens when we need the string form of a value.

For example, `alert(value)` does it to show the value.

We can also call the `String(value)` function to convert a value to a string:

```js run
let value = true;
alert(typeof value); // boolean

*!*
value = String(value); // now value is a string "true"
alert(typeof value); // string
*/!*
```

String conversion is mostly obvious. A `false` becomes `"false"`, `null` becomes `"null"`, etc.

## Numeric Conversion

Numeric conversion happens in mathematical functions and expressions automatically.

For example, when division `/` is applied to non-numbers:

```js run
alert( "6" / "2" ); // 3, strings are converted to numbers
```

We can use the `Number(value)` function to explicitly convert a `value` to a number:

```js run
let str = "123";
alert(typeof str); // string

let num = Number(str); // becomes a number 123

alert(typeof num); // number
```

Explicit conversion is usually required when we read a value from a string-based source like a text form but expect a number to be entered.

If the string is not a valid number, the result of such a conversion is `NaN`. For instance:

```js run
let age = Number("an arbitrary string instead of a number");

alert(age); // NaN, conversion failed
```

Numeric conversion rules:

| Value                                 | Becomes...                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `undefined`                           | `NaN`                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `null`                                | `0`                                                                                                                                                                         |
| <code>true&nbsp;and&nbsp;false</code> | `1` and `0`                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `string`                              | Whitespaces from the start and end are removed. If the remaining string is empty, the result is `0`. Otherwise, the number is "read" from the string. An error gives `NaN`. |

Examples:

```js run
alert( Number("   123   ") ); // 123
alert( Number("123z") );      // NaN (error reading a number at "z")
alert( Number(true) );        // 1
alert( Number(false) );       // 0
```

Please note that `null` and `undefined` behave differently here: `null` becomes zero while `undefined` becomes `NaN`.

Most mathematical operators also perform such conversion, we'll see that in the next chapter.

## Boolean Conversion

Boolean conversion is the simplest one.

It happens in logical operations (later we'll meet condition tests and other similar things) but can also be performed explicitly with a call to `Boolean(value)`.

The conversion rule:

- Values that are intuitively "empty", like `0`, an empty string, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN`, become `false`.
- Other values become `true`.

For instance:

```js run
alert( Boolean(1) ); // true
alert( Boolean(0) ); // false

alert( Boolean("hello") ); // true
alert( Boolean("") ); // false
```

--warn header="Please note: the string with zero `\"0\"` is `true`"
Some languages (namely PHP) treat `"0"` as `false`. But in JavaScript, a non-empty string is always `true`.

```js run
alert( Boolean("0") ); // true
alert( Boolean(" ") ); // spaces, also true (any non-empty string is true)
```

## Summary

The three most widely used type conversions are to string, to number, and to boolean.

**`String Conversion`** -- Occurs when we output something. Can be performed with `String(value)`. The conversion to string is usually obvious for primitive values.

**`Numeric Conversion`** -- Occurs in math operations. Can be performed with `Number(value)`.

The conversion follows the rules:

| Value                               | Becomes...                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `undefined`                         | `NaN`                                                                                                                   |
| `null`                              | `0`                                                                                                                     |
| <code>true&nbsp;/&nbsp;false</code> | `1 / 0`                                                                                                                 |
| `string`                            | The string is read "as is", whitespaces from both sides are ignored. An empty string becomes `0`. An error gives `NaN`. |

**`Boolean Conversion`** -- Occurs in logical operations. Can be performed with `Boolean(value)`.

Follows the rules:

| Value                                 | Becomes... |
|---------------------------------------|------------|
| `0`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, `""` | `false`    |
| any other value                       | `true`     |


Most of these rules are easy to understand and memorize. The notable exceptions where people usually make mistakes are:

- `undefined` is `NaN` as a number, not `0`.
- `"0"` and space-only strings like `"   "` are true as a boolean.

Objects aren't covered here. We'll return to them later in the chapter <info:object-toprimitive> that is devoted exclusively to objects after we learn more basic things about JavaScript.
