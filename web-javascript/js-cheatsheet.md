# Objects

- Objects are *associative arrays* with several special features.

- They store properties (key-value pairs)
  - Property keys must be strings or symbols (usually strings)
  - Values can be of any type.

To access a property
- The dot notation: `obj.property`.
- Square brackets notation `obj["property"]`. Square brackets allow to take the key from a variable, like `obj[varWithKey]`.

Additional operators:
- To delete a property: `delete obj.prop`.
- To check if a property with the given key exists: `"key" in obj`.
- To iterate over an object: `for (let key in obj)` loop.

What we've studied in this chapter is called a "plain object", or just `Object`.

There are many other kinds of objects in JavaScript:

- `Array` to store ordered data collections,
- `Date` to store the information about the date and time,
- `Error` to store the information about an error.
- ...And so on.

# Function

## F1 Summary

A function declaration looks like this:

```js
function name(parameters, delimited, by, comma) {
  /* code */
}
```

- Values passed to a function as parameters are copied to its local variables.
- A function may access outer variables. But it works only from inside out. The code outside of the function doesn't see its local variables.
- A function can return a value. If it doesn't, then its result is `undefined`.

To make the code clean and easy to understand, it's recommended to use mainly local variables and parameters in the function, not outer variables.

It is always easier to understand a function which gets parameters, works with them and returns a result than a function which gets no parameters, but modifies outer variables as a side-effect.

Function naming:

- A name should clearly describe what the function does. When we see a function call in the code, a good name instantly gives us an understanding what it does and returns.
- A function is an action, so function names are usually verbal.
- There exist many well-known function prefixes like `create…`, `show…`, `get…`, `check…` and so on. Use them to hint what a function does.

Functions are the main building blocks of scripts. Now we've covered the basics, so we actually can start creating and using them. But that's only the beginning of the path. We are going to return to them many times, going more deeply into their advanced features.

## F2 Summary

- Functions are values. They can be assigned, copied or declared in any place of the code.
- If the function is declared as a separate statement in the main code flow, that's called a "Function Declaration".
- If the function is created as a part of an expression, it's called a "Function Expression".
- Function Declarations are processed before the code block is executed. They are visible everywhere in the block.
- Function Expressions are created when the execution flow reaches them.

In most cases when we need to declare a function, a Function Declaration is preferable, because it is visible prior to the declaration itself. That gives us more flexibility in code organization, and is usually more readable.

So we should use a Function Expression only when a Function Declaration is not fit for the task. We've seen a couple of examples of that in this chapter, and will see more in the future.

## F3 Summary

Arrow functions are handy for one-liners. They come in two flavors:

1. Without curly braces: `(...args) => expression` -- the right side is an expression: the function evaluates it and returns the result.
2. With curly braces: `(...args) => { body }` -- brackets allow us to write multiple statements inside the function, but we need an explicit `return` to return something.

## Snips

### Function Declaration

```js
function sayHi() {
  alert( "Hello" );
}
```

### Function Expression

```js
let sayHi = function() {
  alert( "Hello" );
};
```

- With arguments

```js
let func = function(arg1, arg2, ..., argN) {
  return expression;
};
```

### Arrow Function

```js
let func = (arg1, arg2, ..., argN) => expression
```

### Calling Function

```js
sayHi();
```

# Modules

- Before declaration of a class/function/..:
  - `export [default] class/function/variable ...`
- Standalone export:
  - `export {x [as y], ...}`.
- Re-export:
  - `export {x [as y], ...} from "module"`
  - `export * from "module"` (doesn't re-export default).
  - `export {default [as y]} from "module"` (re-export default).

Import:

- Importing named exports:
  - `import {x [as y], ...} from "module"`
- Importing the default export:  
  - `import x from "module"`
  - `import {default as x} from "module"`
- Import all:
  - `import * as obj from "module"`
- Import the module (its code runs), but do not assign any of its exports to variables:
  - `import "module"`

We can put `import/export` statements at the top or at the bottom of a script, that doesn't matter.
