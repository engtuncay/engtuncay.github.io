# Understanding Type Annotations in TypeScript

Summary: in this tutorial, you will learn about type annotations in TypeScript.

*What is Type Annotation in TypeScript*

TypeScript uses type annotations to explicitly specify types for identifiers such variables, functions, objects, etc.

TypeScript uses the syntax `: type` after an identifier as the type annotation, where type can be any valid type.

Once an identifier is annotated with a type, it can be used as that type only. If the identifier is used as a different type, the TypeScript compiler will issue an error.

Type annotations in variables and constants
The following syntax shows how to specify type annotations for variables and constants:

let variableName: type;
let variableName: type = value;
const constantName: type = value;
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
In this syntax, the type annotation comes after the variable or constant name and is preceded by a colon (:).

The following example uses number annotation for a variable:

let counter: number;
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
After this, you can only assign a number to the counter variable:

counter = 1;
If you assign a string to the counter variable, you’ll get an error:

let counter: number;
counter = 'Hello'; // compile error 
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
Error:

Type '"Hello"' is not assignable to type 'number'.
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
You can both use a type annotation for a variable and initialize it in a single statement like this:

let counter: number = 1;
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
In this example, we use the number annotation for the counter variable and initialize it to one.

The following shows other examples of primitive type annotations:

let name: string = 'John';
let age: number = 25;
let active: boolean = true;
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
In this example, the name variable gets the string type, the age variable gets the number type, and the active variable gets the boolean type.

Type annotation examples
Arrays
To annotate an array type you use use a specific type followed by a square bracket : type[] :

let arrayName: type[];
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
For example, the following declares an array of strings:

let names: string[] = ['John', 'Jane', 'Peter', 'David', 'Mary'];
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
Objects
To specify a type for an object, you use the object type annotation. For example:

let person: {
   name: string;
   age: number
};

person = {
   name: 'John',
   age: 25
}; // valid
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
In this example, the person object only accepts an object that has two properties: name with the string type and age with the number type.

Function arguments & return types
The following shows a function annotation with parameter type annotation and return type annotation:

let greeting : (name: string) => string;
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
In this example, you can assign any function that accepts a string and returns a string to the greeting variable:

greeting = function (name: string) {
    return `Hi ${name}`;
};
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
The following causes an error because the function that is assigned to the greeting variable doesn’t match with its function type.

greeting = function () {
    console.log('Hello');
};
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
Error:

Type '() => void' is not assignable to type '(name: string) => string'. Type 'void' is not assignable to type 'string'.
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
Summary
Use type annotations with the syntax : [type] to explicitly specify a type for a variable, function, function return value, etc.
