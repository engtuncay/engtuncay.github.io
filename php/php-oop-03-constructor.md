# OOP - Constructor

ðŸ””  *The __construct Function*

A constructor allows you to initialize an object's properties upon creation of the object.

If you create a __construct() function, PHP will automatically call this function when you create an object from a class.

*Notice that* the construct function starts with two underscores (__)!

We see in the example below, that using a constructor saves us from calling the set_name() method which reduces the amount of code:

*Example*

```php
<?php
class Fruit {
  public $name;
  public $color;

  function __construct($name) {
    $this->name = $name;
  }

  function get_name() {
    return $this->name;
  }
}

$apple = new Fruit("Apple");
echo $apple->get_name();
?>

```

Another example:

```php
<?php
class Fruit {
  public $name;
  public $color;

  function __construct($name, $color) {
    $this->name = $name;
    $this->color = $color;
  }
  function get_name() {
    return $this->name;
  }
  function get_color() {
    return $this->color;
  }
}

$apple = new Fruit("Apple", "red");
echo $apple->get_name();
echo "<br>";
echo $apple->get_color();
?>

```

# PHP OOP - Destructor

*PHP - The __destruct Function*

A destructor is called when the object is destructed or the script is stopped or exited.

If you create a __destruct() function, PHP will automatically call this function *at the end of the script*.

Notice that the destruct function starts with two underscores (__)!

The example below has a __construct() function that is automatically called when you create an object from a class, and a __destruct() function that is automatically called at the end of the script:

Example

```php
<?php
class Fruit {
  public $name;
  public $color;

  function __construct($name) {
    $this->name = $name;
  }
  // executes at the end of the script 
  function __destruct() {
    echo "The fruit is {$this->name}.";
  }
}

$apple = new Fruit("Apple");
echo "Hello<br/>";
//---Output---
// Hello
// The fruit is Apple.
?>

```

# PHP OOP - Access Modifiers

*PHP - Access Modifiers*

Properties and methods can have access modifiers which control where they can be accessed.

There are three access modifiers:

- public - the property or method can be accessed from everywhere. This is *default*
- protected - the property or method can be accessed within the class and by classes derived from that class
- private - the property or method can ONLY be accessed within the class

In the following example we have added three different access modifiers to three properties (name, color, and weight). Here, if you try to set the name property it will work fine (because the name property is public, and can be accessed from everywhere). However, if you try to set the color or weight property it will result in a fatal error (because the color and weight property are protected and private):

Example

```php
<?php
class Fruit {
  public $name;
  protected $color;
  private $weight;
}

$mango = new Fruit();
$mango->name = 'Mango'; // OK
$mango->color = 'Yellow'; // ERROR
$mango->weight = '300'; // ERROR
?>

```

In the next example we have added access modifiers to two functions. Here, if you try to call the set_color() or the set_weight() function it will result in a fatal error (because the two functions are considered protected and private), even if all the properties are public:

Example

```php
<?php
class Fruit {
  public $name;
  public $color;
  public $weight;

  function set_name($n) {  // a public function (default)
    $this->name = $n;
  }
  protected function set_color($n) { // a protected function
    $this->color = $n;
  }
  private function set_weight($n) { // a private function
    $this->weight = $n;
  }
}

$mango = new Fruit();
$mango->set_name('Mango'); // OK
$mango->set_color('Yellow'); // ERROR
$mango->set_weight('300'); // ERROR
?>

```

# PHP OOP - Class Constants

*PHP - Class Constants*

Constants cannot be changed once it is declared.

Class constants can be useful if you need to define some constant data within a class.

A class constant is declared inside a class with the const keyword.

Class constants are *case-sensitive*. However, it is recommended to name the constants in *all uppercase letters*.

We can access a constant from outside the class by using the class name followed by the scope resolution operator (::) followed by the constant name, like here:

Example

```php
<?php
class Goodbye {
  const LEAVING_MESSAGE = "Thank you for visiting W3Schools.com!";
}

echo Goodbye::LEAVING_MESSAGE;
?>

```

Or, we can access a constant from inside the class by using the `self` keyword followed by the scope resolution operator (::) followed by the constant name, like here:

Example

```php
<?php
class Goodbye {
  
  const LEAVING_MESSAGE = "Thank you for visiting W3Schools.com!";
  
  public function byebye() {
    echo self::LEAVING_MESSAGE;
  }
}

$goodbye = new Goodbye();
$goodbye->byebye();
?>

```
