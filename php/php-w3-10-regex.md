# PHP Regular Expressions

Source : https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_regex.asp

ðŸ’¡ What is a Regular Expression?

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms `a search pattern`. When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.

A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.

Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.

Syntax

In PHP, regular expressions are strings composed of `delimiters (/), a pattern and optional modifiers`.

```php
$exp = "/w3schools/i";

```

In the example above, `/` is the delimiter, w3schools is the `pattern` that is being searched for, and `i` is a modifier that makes the search case-insensitive.

The delimiter can be any character that is not a letter, number, backslash or space. The most common delimiter is `the forward slash (/)`, but when your pattern contains forward slashes it is convenient to choose other delimiters such as `# or ~`.

## Regular Expression Functions

PHP provides a variety of functions that allow you to use regular expressions.

The most common functions are:

Function         | Description
-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
preg_match()     | Returns 1 if `the pattern was found` in the string and 0 if not
preg_match_all() | Returns `the number of times the pattern` was found in the string, which may also be 0 or to find the matched parts
preg_replace()   | Returns a new string where matched patterns have been replaced with another string

## preg_match()

The preg_match() function will tell you whether a string contains matches of a pattern.

Example : Use a regular expression to do a case-insensitive search for "w3schools" in a string:

```php
$str = "Visit W3Schools";
$pattern = "/w3schools/i";
echo preg_match($pattern, $str);

```

## preg_match_all()

The preg_match_all() function will tell you how many matches were found for a pattern in a string.

Example : Use a regular expression to do a case-insensitive count of the number of occurrences of "ain" in a string:


```php
$str = "The rain in SPAIN falls mainly on the plains.";
$pattern = "/ain/i";
echo preg_match_all($pattern, $str);

```

âž– find the matched parts

```php
preg_match_all($pattern, $str, $matches, PREG_SET_ORDER);

foreach ($matches as $m) {
  echo $m[0];
  echo "\n";
}
```

```php
$str2 = "The rain in SPAIN falls mainly on the plains.";
$pattern2 = "/f(all).*(ain)/i";

preg_match_all($pattern2, $str2, $matches2, PREG_SET_ORDER);

foreach ($matches2 as $m) {
  echo "m0:" . $m[0];
  echo "\n";
  if (!empty($m[1])) {
    echo "m1:" . $m[1];
    echo "\n";
  }
}
```





## preg_replace()

The preg_replace() function will replace all of the matches of the pattern in a string with another string.

Example : Use a case-insensitive regular expression to replace Microsoft with W3Schools in a string:


```php
$str = "Visit Microsoft!";
$pattern = "/microsoft/i";
echo preg_replace($pattern, "W3Schools", $str);

```

## Regular Expression Modifiers

Modifiers can change how a search is performed.

Modifier | Description
---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
i        | Performs a case-insensitive search
m        | Performs a multiline search (patterns that search for a match at the beginning or end of a string will now match the beginning or end of each line)
u        | Enables correct matching of UTF-8 encoded patterns

## Regular Expression Patterns

Brackets are used to find a range of characters:

Expression | Description
-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[abc]      | Find one or many of the characters inside the brackets
[^abc]     | Find any character NOT between the brackets
[a-z]      | Find any character alphabetically between two letters
[A-z]      | Find any character alphabetically between a specified upper-case letter and a specified lower-case letter
[A-Z]      | Find any character alphabetically between two upper-case letters.
[123]      | Find one or many of the digits inside the brackets
[0-5]      | Find any digits between the two numbers
[0-9]      | Find any digits

### Metacharacters

Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:

Metacharacter	| Description
---|---
\|	| Find a match for any one of the patterns separated by | as in: cat|dog|fish	
.	|Find any character	
^	|Finds a match as the beginning of a string as in: ^Hello	
$	|Finds a match at the end of the string as in: World$	
\d|	Find any digits	
\D|	Find any non-digits	
\s|	Find any whitespace character	
\S|	Find any non-whitespace character	
\w|	Find any alphabetical letter (a to Z) and digit (0 to 9)	
\W|	Find any non-alphabetical and non-digit character	
\b|	Find a match at the beginning of a word like this: \bWORD, or at the end of a word like this: WORD\b	
\uxxxx	|Find the Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal number xxxx	

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers define quantities:

Quantifier | Description
-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
n+         | Matches any string that contains at least one n
n*         | Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
n?         | Matches any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n
n{3}       | Matches any string that contains a sequence of 3 n's
n{2, 5}    | Matches any string that contains a sequence of at least 2, but not more that 5 n's
n{3,}      | Matches any string that contains a sequence of at least 3 n's

Note: If your expression needs to search for one of the special characters you can use a backslash `( \ )` to escape them. For example, to search for one or more question marks you can use the following expression: `$pattern = '/\?+/';`

### Grouping

You can use parentheses `( )` to apply quantifiers to entire patterns. They also can be used to select parts of the pattern to be used as a match.

Example : Use grouping to search for the word "banana" by looking for ba followed by two instances of na:

```php
$str = "Apples and bananas.";
$pattern = "/ba(na){2}/i";
echo preg_match($pattern, $str);

```

# Loop In Matches

```php
$re = '@\[([a-zA-Z0-9]+)\]|[][=?~#!]@';
$strs =array('DeviceLocation[West12]', '#=Device', '?[1234]=#Martin');

preg_match_all($re, $str, $matches, PREG_SET_ORDER);
$results = array();
$match_val = "";
foreach ($matches as $m) {
    if (!empty($m[1])) {
        $match_val = trim($m[1], "[]");
        array_push($results, "[]");
    } else {
        array_push($results, $m[0]);
    } 
}
echo "Value: " . $match_val . "\n";
echo "Symbols: " . implode(", ", $results);
echo "\n-----\n";
