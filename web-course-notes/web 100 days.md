## 15 Why Visual Studio Code

Now we did set up Visual Studio Code and here's our HTML code from before opened in Visual Studio Code.

Now before we dig deeper into HTML and into understanding HTML,

which we're going to do in the next lecture,

I want to show you some of the reasons

why we switched to Visual Studio Code.

- syntax highlighting

- In addition, we, for example, can hover over this h1 element and we get extra information about it. We even get a link, which we can click, which takes us to a website, the MDN web documentation, which is kind of like the official documentation for HTML and web technologies, where we can learn more about that specific HTML element. (çıkan extra info daki linke tıklayınca mdn reference sayfasına gidiyor.)

And if we write an element, if we add an element, for example, automatically gives us this closing part of the element.

That's another little convenience feature,

which it gives us,

which also helps us avoid errors,

because with that, for example, it's more difficult for us to forget this important forward slash on the closing part of our element here of our HTML code.
