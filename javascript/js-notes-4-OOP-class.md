# Section - OOP (Classes)

Object Oriented Programming

## Classes

JavaScript is an object oriented programming language (??). Everything in JavaScript is an object, with its properties and methods. We create class to create an object. A Class is like `an object constructor, or a blueprint for creating objects`. We instantiate a class to create an object. The class defines attributes and methods (the behavior of the object).

Creating an object from a class is called `class instantiation` (Ã¶rnekleme).

In the object section, we saw how to create `an object literal`. Object literal is a singleton. If we want to get a similar object , we have to write it. However, class allows to create many objects. This helps to reduce amount of code and repetition of code.

### Defining a class

To define a class in JavaScript we need the keyword `class` , the name of a class in **CamelCase** and block code (two curly brackets). 

Let us create a class name Person.

```js
// syntax
class ClassName {
    //  code goes here
}

```

ðŸ§² Example

```js
class Person {
  // code goes here
}
```

We have created a Person class but it does not have any thing inside...

### Creating Object (Class Instantiation)

Instantiation class means creating an object from a class. We need the keyword `new`.

Let us create a object from our Person class previously defined.

```js
const person = new Person();
console.log(person)

// -- Output --
// PersonÂ {}
```

As you can see, we have created a person object. Since the class did not have any properties yet the object is also empty.

Let use the class constructor to pass different properties for the class.

### Class Constructor

The constructor is `a builtin function`. The constructor function starts with a keyword `constructor` followed by a parenthesis. Constructor method may have parameters. `this` keyword refers the created object.

The following Person class constructor has firstName and lastName parameters. These parameters are attached to the Person object using _this_ keyword.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    console.log(this)
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
  }
}

const person = new Person()

console.log(person)

// -- Output --
// Person {}
// PersonÂ {firstName: undefined, lastName:undefined}
```

All the keys of the object are undefined. Let us pass value at this time when we instantiate the class.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
  }
}

const person2 = new Person('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh')

console.log(person2)

// -- Output --
// PersonÂ {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh"}
```

Once we define a class, we can create many object using the class. Now, let us create many person objects using the Person class.

```js
const person1 = new Person('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh')
const person2 = new Person('Lidiya', 'Tekle')
const person3 = new Person('Abraham', 'Yetayeh')

console.log(person1)
console.log(person2)
console.log(person3)

// -- Output --
// PersonÂ {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh"}
// PersonÂ {firstName: "Lidiya", lastName: "Tekle"}
// PersonÂ {firstName: "Abraham", lastName: "Yetayeh"}
```

### Default values for parameters

The constructor function properties may have a default value like other regular functions.

```js
class Person {
  constructor( firstName = 'Asabeneh', lastName = 'Yetayeh',) 
  {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
  }
}

const person1 = new Person() // it will take the default values
const person2 = new Person('Lidiya', 'Tekle')

console.log(person1)
console.log(person2)

// -- Output --
// PersonÂ {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh"}
// PersonÂ {firstName: "Lidiya", lastName: "Tekle"}

```
### Class methods

In a class we can create class methods. Methods are JavaScript functions inside the class. Let us create some class methods.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age, country, city) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.age = age
    this.country = country
    this.city = city
  }

  getFullName() {
    const fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
    return fullName;
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh', 250, 'Finland', 'Helsinki')
const person2 = new Person('Lidiya', 'Tekle', 28, 'Finland', 'Espoo')

console.log(person1.getFullName())
console.log(person2.getFullName())

// -- Output --
// Asabeneh Yetayeh
// test.js:19 Lidiya Tekle
```

### Properties with initial value

If you want to give initial value for fields of a class, you can do it in  the constructor method.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.score = 0
    this.skills = []
  }

  getFullName() {
    const fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    return fullName
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh')

console.log(person1.score)
console.log(person1.skills)

// -- Output --
// 0
// []
```

A method could be regular method or a getter or a setter. Let us see, getter and setter.

### Getter

The get method allow us to access value from the object. We write a get method using keyword _get_ followed by a function. Instead of accessing properties directly from the object we use getter to get the value. See the example bellow

```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.score = 0
    this.skills = []
  }
  getFullName() {
    const fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    return fullName
  }
  get getScore() {
    return this.score
  }
  get getSkills() {
    return this.skills
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh')
const person2 = new Person('Lidiya', 'Tekle')

console.log(person1.getScore) // We do not need parenthesis to call a getter method
console.log(person2.getScore)

console.log(person1.getSkills)
console.log(person2.getSkills)

// -- Output --
// 0
// 0
// []
// []
```

### Setter

The setter method allow us to modify the value of certain properties. We write a setter method using keyword _set_ followed by a function. See the example bellow.

```js

class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.score = 0
    this.skills = []
  }

  getFullName() {
    const fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    return fullName
  }

  get getScore() {
    return this.score
  }

  get getSkills() {
    return this.skills
  }

  set setScore(score) {
    this.score += score
  }

  set setSkill(skill) {
    this.skills.push(skill)
  }

}

const person1 = new Person('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh')
const person2 = new Person('Lidiya', 'Tekle')

person1.setScore = 1
person1.setSkill = 'HTML'
person1.setSkill = 'CSS'
person1.setSkill = 'JavaScript'

person2.setScore = 1
person2.setSkill = 'Planning'
person2.setSkill = 'Managing'
person2.setSkill = 'Organizing'

console.log(person1.score)
console.log(person2.score)

console.log(person1.skills)
console.log(person2.skills)
```

```js
// 1
// 1
// ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"]
// ["Planning", "Managing", "Organizing"]
```

Do not be puzzled by the difference between regular method and a getter. If you know how to make a regular method you are good. Let us add regular method called getPersonInfo in the Person class.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.score = 0
    this.skills = []
  }
  getFullName() {
    const fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    return fullName
  }
  get getScore() {
    return this.score
  }
  get getSkills() {
    return this.skills
  }
  set setScore(score) {
    this.score += score
  }
  set setSkill(skill) {
    this.skills.push(skill)
  }

  getPersonInfo() {
    let fullName = this.getFullName()
    let skills =
      this.skills.length > 0 &&
      this.skills.slice(0, this.skills.length - 1).join(', ') +
        ` and ${this.skills[this.skills.length - 1]}`
    let formattedSkills = skills ? `He knows ${skills}` : ''

    let info = `${fullName} is ${this.age}. He lives ${this.city}, ${this.country}. ${formattedSkills}`
    return info
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh', 250, 'Finland', 'Helsinki')
const person2 = new Person('Lidiya', 'Tekle', 28, 'Finland', 'Espoo')
const person3 = new Person('John', 'Doe', 50, 'Mars', 'Mars city')

person1.setScore = 1
person1.setSkill = 'HTML'
person1.setSkill = 'CSS'
person1.setSkill = 'JavaScript'

person2.setScore = 1
person2.setSkill = 'Planning'
person2.setSkill = 'Managing'
person2.setSkill = 'Organizing'

console.log(person1.getScore)
console.log(person2.getScore)

console.log(person1.getSkills)
console.log(person2.getSkills)
console.log(person3.getSkills)

console.log(person1.getPersonInfo())
console.log(person2.getPersonInfo())
console.log(person3.getPersonInfo())
```

```js
// 1
// 1
// ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"]
// ["Planning", "Managing", "Organizing"]
// []
// Asabeneh Yetayeh is 250. He lives Helsinki, Finland. He knows HTML, CSS and JavaScript
// Lidiya Tekle is 28. He lives Espoo, Finland. He knows Planning, Managing and Organizing
// John Doe is 50. He lives Mars city, Mars.
```

### Static method

`The static keyword` defines a static method for a class. 

Static methods are not called on instances of the class. Instead, they are called on the class itself. 

These are often utility functions, such as functions to create or clone objects. An example of static method is `Date.now()`. The _now_ method is called directly from the class.

```js
class UtilDate {
  
  static showDateTime() {
    let now = new Date()
    return now;
  }

}

console.log(UtilDate.showDateTime())

// -- Output --
// 2024-10-11T11:24:11.767Z
```

## Inheritance

Using inheritance we can access all the properties and the methods of the parent class. This reduces repetition of code. If you remember, we have a Person parent class and we will create children from it. Our children class could be student, teach etc.

```js
// syntax
class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
 // code goes here
}
```

Let us create a Student child class from Person parent class.

```js
class Student extends Person {
  saySomething() {
    console.log('I am a child of the person class')
  }
}

const s1 = new Student('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh')
console.log(s1)
console.log(s1.saySomething())
console.log(s1.getFullName())
console.log(s1.getPersonInfo())
```

```js
// StudentÂ {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh", age: "Finland", country: 250, city: "Helsinki",Â â€¦}
// I am a child of the person class
// Asabeneh Yetayeh
// StudentÂ {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh", age: "Finland", country: 250, city: "Helsinki",Â â€¦}
// Asabeneh Yetayeh is Finland. He lives Helsinki, 250.
```

### Overriding methods

As you can see, we manage to access all the methods in the Person Class and we used it in the Student child class. We can customize the parent methods, we can add additional properties to a child class. If we want to customize, the methods and if we want to add extra properties, we need to use the constructor function the child class too. Inside the constructor function we call the super() function to access all the properties from the parent class. The Person class didn't have gender but now let us give gender property for the child class, Student. If the same method name used in the child class, the parent method will be overridden.

```js
class Student extends Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, gender) {
    super(firstName, lastName)
    this.gender = gender
  }

  saySomething() {
    console.log('I am a child of the person class')
  }
  getPersonInfo() {
    let fullName = this.getFullName()
    let skills =
      this.skills.length > 0 &&
      this.skills.slice(0, this.skills.length - 1).join(', ') +
        ` and ${this.skills[this.skills.length - 1]}`

    let formattedSkills = skills ? `He knows ${skills}` : ''
    let pronoun = this.gender == 'Male' ? 'He' : 'She'

    let info = `${fullName} is ${this.age}. ${pronoun} lives in ${this.city}, ${this.country}. ${formattedSkills}`
    return info
  }
}

const s1 = new Student('Asabeneh','Yetayeh','Male')
const s2 = new Student('Lidiya', 'Tekle', 'Female')

s1.setScore = 1
s1.setSkill = 'HTML'
s1.setSkill = 'CSS'
s1.setSkill = 'JavaScript'

s2.setScore = 1
s2.setSkill = 'Planning'
s2.setSkill = 'Managing'
s2.setSkill = 'Organizing'

console.log(s1)

console.log(s1.saySomething())
console.log(s1.getFullName())
console.log(s1.getPersonInfo())

console.log(s2.saySomething())
console.log(s2.getFullName())
console.log(s2.getPersonInfo())
```

```js
// StudentÂ {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh", age: 250, country: "Finland", city: "Helsinki",Â â€¦}
// StudentÂ {firstName: "Lidiya", lastName: "Tekle", age: 28, country: "Finland", city: "Helsinki",Â â€¦}
// I am a child of the person class
// Asabeneh Yetayeh
// StudentÂ {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh", age: 250, country: "Finland", city: "Helsinki",Â â€¦}
// Asabeneh Yetayeh is 250. He lives in Helsinki, Finland. He knows HTML, CSS and JavaScript
// I am a child of the person class
// Lidiya Tekle
// StudentÂ {firstName: "Lidiya", lastName: "Tekle", age: 28, country: "Finland", city: "Helsinki",Â â€¦}
// Lidiya Tekle is 28. She lives in Helsinki, Finland. He knows Planning, Managing and Organizing
```

Now, the getPersonInfo method has been overridden and it identifies if the person is male or female.


```js
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.score = 0
    this.skills = []
  }

  getFullName() {
    const fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    return fullName
  }

  get getScore() {
    return this.score
  }

  get getSkills() {
    return this.skills
  }

  set setScore(score) {
    this.score += score
  }

  set setSkill(skill) {
    this.skills.push(skill)
  }

  getPersonInfo() {
    let fullName = this.getFullName()
    let skills =
      this.skills.length > 0 &&
      this.skills.slice(0, this.skills.length - 1).join(', ') +
        ` and ${this.skills[this.skills.length - 1]}`

    let formattedSkills = skills ? `He knows ${skills}` : ''

    let info = `${fullName} is ${this.age}. He lives ${this.city}, ${this.country}. ${formattedSkills}`
    return info
  }
  
  static favoriteSkill() {
    const skills = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Python', 'Node']
    const index = Math.floor(Math.random() * skills.length)
    return skills[index]
  }

  static showDateTime() {
    let now = new Date()
    let year = now.getFullYear()
    let month = now.getMonth() + 1
    let date = now.getDate()
    let hours = now.getHours()
    let minutes = now.getMinutes()
    if (hours < 10) {
      hours = '0' + hours
    }
    if (minutes < 10) {
      minutes = '0' + minutes
    }

    let dateMonthYear = date + '.' + month + '.' + year
    let time = hours + ':' + minutes
    let fullTime = dateMonthYear + ' ' + time
    return fullTime
  }
}

console.log(Person.favoriteSkill())
console.log(Person.showDateTime())
```


## Public Class Fields (Art)

Source : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Public_class_fields

Public fields are writable, enumerable, and configurable properties. As such, unlike their private counterparts, they participate in prototype inheritance.

Syntax

```js
class ClassWithField {
  instanceField;
  instanceFieldWithInitializer = "instance field";
  static staticField;
  static staticFieldWithInitializer = "static field";
}

```

There are some additional syntax restrictions:

- The name of a static property (field or method) cannot be prototype.
- The name of a class field (static or instance) cannot be constructor.

âž– Description

This page introduces public instance fields in detail.

- For public static fields, see static. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/static)

- For private fields, see private properties. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_properties)

- For public methods, see method definitions. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions)
  
- For public accessors, see getter and setter. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set)

Public instance fields exist on every created instance of a class. By declaring a public field, you can ensure the field is always present, and the class definition is more self-documenting.

Public instance fields are added to the instance either at construction time in the base class (before the constructor body runs), or just after `super()` returns in a subclass. Fields without initializers are initialized to `undefined`. Like properties, field names may be computed.

```js
const PREFIX = "prefix";

class ClassWithField {
  field;
  fieldWithInitializer = "instance field";
  [`${PREFIX}Field`] = "prefixed field";
}

```

const instance = new ClassWithField();
console.log(Object.hasOwn(instance, "field")); // true
console.log(instance.field); // undefined
console.log(instance.fieldWithInitializer); // "instance field"
console.log(instance.prefixField); // "prefixed field"
Computed field names are only evaluated once, at class definition time. This means that each class always has a fixed set of field names, and two instances cannot have different field names via computed names. The this value in the computed expression is the this surrounding the class definition, and referring to the class's name is a ReferenceError because the class is not initialized yet. await and yield work as expected in this expression.

js
Copy to Clipboard
class C {
  [Math.random()] = 1;
}

console.log(new C());
console.log(new C());
// Both instances have the same field name
In the field initializer, this refers to the class instance under construction, and super refers to the prototype property of the base class, which contains the base class's instance methods, but not its instance fields.

js
Copy to Clipboard
class Base {
  baseField = "base field";
  anotherBaseField = this.baseField;
  baseMethod() {
    return "base method output";
  }
}

class Derived extends Base {
  subField = super.baseMethod();
}

const base = new Base();
const sub = new Derived();

console.log(base.anotherBaseField); // "base field"

console.log(sub.subField); // "base method output"
The field initializer expression is evaluated each time a new instance is created. (Because the this value is different for each instance, the initializer expression can access instance-specific properties.)

js
Copy to Clipboard
class C {
  obj = {};
}

const instance1 = new C();
const instance2 = new C();
console.log(instance1.obj === instance2.obj); // false
The expression is evaluated synchronously. You cannot use await or yield in the initializer expression. (Think of the initializer expression as being implicitly wrapped in a function.)

Because instance fields of a class are added before the respective constructor runs, you can access the fields' values within the constructor. However, because instance fields of a derived class are defined after super() returns, the base class's constructor does not have access to the derived class's fields.

js
Copy to Clipboard
class Base {
  constructor() {
    console.log("Base constructor:", this.field);
  }
}

class Derived extends Base {
  field = 1;
  constructor() {
    super();
    console.log("Derived constructor:", this.field);
    this.field = 2;
  }
}

const instance = new Derived();
// Base constructor: undefined
// Derived constructor: 1
console.log(instance.field); // 2
Fields are added one-by-one. Field initializers can refer to field values above it, but not below it. All instance and static methods are added beforehand and can be accessed, although calling them may not behave as expected if they refer to fields below the one being initialized.

js
Copy to Clipboard
class C {
  a = 1;
  b = this.c;
  c = this.a + 1;
  d = this.c + 1;
}

const instance = new C();
console.log(instance.d); // 3
console.log(instance.b); // undefined
Note: This is more important with private fields, because accessing a non-initialized private field throws a TypeError, even if the private field is declared below. (If the private field is not declared, it would be an early SyntaxError.)

Because class fields are added using the [[DefineOwnProperty]] semantic (which is essentially Object.defineProperty()), field declarations in derived classes do not invoke setters in the base class. This behavior differs from using this.field = â€¦ in the constructor.

js
Copy to Clipboard
class Base {
  set field(val) {
    console.log(val);
  }
}

class DerivedWithField extends Base {
  field = 1;
}

const instance = new DerivedWithField(); // No log

class DerivedWithConstructor extends Base {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.field = 1;
  }
}

const instance2 = new DerivedWithConstructor(); // Logs 1
Note: Before the class fields specification was finalized with the [[DefineOwnProperty]] semantic, most transpilers, including Babel and tsc, transformed class fields to the DerivedWithConstructor form, which has caused subtle bugs after class fields were standardized.

Examples
Using class fields
Class fields cannot depend on arguments of the constructor, so field initializers usually evaluate to the same value for each instance (unless the same expression can evaluate to different values each time, such as Date.now() or object initializers).

js
Copy to Clipboard
class Person {
  name = nameArg; // nameArg is out of scope of the constructor
  constructor(nameArg) {}
}
js
Copy to Clipboard
class Person {
  // All instances of Person will have the same name
  name = "Dragomir";
}
However, even declaring an empty class field is beneficial, because it indicates the existence of the field, which allows type checkers as well as human readers to statically analyze the shape of the class.

js
Copy to Clipboard
class Person {
  name;
  age;
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}
The code above seems repetitive, but consider the case where this is dynamically mutated: the explicit field declaration makes it clear which fields will definitely be present on the instance.

js
Copy to Clipboard
class Person {
  name;
  age;
  constructor(properties) {
    Object.assign(this, properties);
  }
}
Because initializers are evaluated after the base class has executed, you can access properties created by the base class constructor.

js
Copy to Clipboard
class Person {
  name;
  age;
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

class Professor extends Person {
  name = `Professor ${this.name}`;
}
