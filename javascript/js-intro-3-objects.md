# Objects - The Basics

As we know from the chapter Data Types, there are eight data types in JavaScript. Seven of them are called "primitive", because their values contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever).

In contrast, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. In JavaScript, objects penetrate almost every aspect of the language. So we must understand them first before going in-depth anywhere else.

An object can be created with figure brackets `{…}` with an optional list of *properties*. A property is a "key: value" pair, where `key` is a string (also called a "property name"), and `value` can be anything.

We can imagine an object as a cabinet with signed files. Every piece of data is stored in its file by the key. It's easy to find a file by its name or add/remove a file.

![](./img/jsinfo/object.svg)

An empty object ("empty cabinet") can be created using one of two syntaxes:

```js
let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
let user = {};  // "object literal" syntax
```

![](object-user-empty.svg)

Usually, the figure brackets `{...}` are used. That declaration is called an *object literal*.

## Literals and properties

We can immediately put some properties into `{...}` as "key: value" pairs:

```js
let user = {     // an object
  name: "John",  // by key "name" store value "John"
  age: 30        // by key "age" store value 30
};
```

A property has a key (also known as "name" or "identifier") before the colon `":"` and a value to the right of it.

In the `user` object, there are two properties:

1. The first property has the name `"name"` and the value `"John"`.
2. The second one has the name `"age"` and the value `30`.

The resulting `user` object can be imagined as a cabinet with two signed files labeled "name" and "age".

![user object](object-user.svg)

We can add, remove and read files from it any time.

Property values are accessible using the dot notation:

```js
// get property values of the object:
alert( user.name ); // John
alert( user.age ); // 30
```

The value can be of any type. Let's add a boolean one:

```js
user.isAdmin = true;
```

![user object 2](object-user-isadmin.svg)

To remove a property, we can use `delete` operator:

```js
delete user.age;
```

![user object 3](object-user-delete.svg)

We can also use multiword property names, but then they must be quoted:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  "likes birds": true  // multiword property name must be quoted
};
```

![](object-user-props.svg)


The last property in the list may end with a comma:
```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30*!*,*/!*
}
```
That is called a "trailing" or "hanging" comma. Makes it easier to add/remove/move around properties, because all lines become alike.

## Square brackets

For multiword properties, the dot access doesn't work:

```js run
// this would give a syntax error
user.likes birds = true
```

JavaScript doesn't understand that. It thinks that we address `user.likes`, and then gives a syntax error when comes across unexpected `birds`.

The dot requires the key to be a valid variable identifier. That implies: contains no spaces, doesn't start with a digit and doesn't include special characters (`$` and `_` are allowed).

There's an alternative "square bracket notation" that works with any string:

```js run
let user = {};

// set
user["likes birds"] = true;

// get
alert(user["likes birds"]); // true

// delete
delete user["likes birds"];
```

Now everything is fine. Please note that the string inside the brackets is properly quoted (any type of quotes will do).

Square brackets also provide a way to obtain the property name as the result of any expression -- as opposed to a literal string -- like from a variable as follows:

```js
let key = "likes birds";

// same as user["likes birds"] = true;
user[key] = true;
```

Here, the variable `key` may be calculated at run-time or depend on the user input. And then we use it to access the property. That gives us a great deal of flexibility.

For instance:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

let key = prompt("What do you want to know about the user?", "name");

// access by variable
alert( user[key] ); // John (if enter "name")
```

The dot notation cannot be used in a similar way:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

let key = "name";
alert( user.key ) // undefined
```

### Computed properties

We can use square brackets in an object literal, when creating an object. That's called *computed properties*.

For instance:

```js run
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");

let bag = {
*!*
  [fruit]: 5, // the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit
*/!*
};

alert( bag.apple ); // 5 if fruit="apple"
```

The meaning of a computed property is simple: `[fruit]` means that the property name should be taken from `fruit`.

So, if a visitor enters `"apple"`, `bag` will become `{apple: 5}`.

Essentially, that works the same as:
```js run
let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");
let bag = {};

// take property name from the fruit variable
bag[fruit] = 5;
```

...But looks nicer.

We can use more complex expressions inside square brackets:

```js
let fruit = 'apple';
let bag = {
  [fruit + 'Computers']: 5 // bag.appleComputers = 5
};
```

Square brackets are much more powerful than the dot notation. They allow any property names and variables. But they are also more cumbersome to write.

So most of the time, when property names are known and simple, the dot is used. And if we need something more complex, then we switch to square brackets.

## Property value shorthand

In real code we often use existing variables as values for property names.

For instance:

```js run
function makeUser(name, age) {
  return {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    // ...other properties
  };
}

let user = makeUser("John", 30);
alert(user.name); // John
```

In the example above, properties have the same names as variables. The use-case of making a property from a variable is so common, that there's a special *property value shorthand* to make it shorter.

Instead of `name:name` we can just write `name`, like this:

```js
function makeUser(name, age) {
*!*
  return {
    name, // same as name: name
    age,  // same as age: age
    // ...
  };
*/!*
}
```

We can use both normal properties and shorthands in the same object:

```js
let user = {
  name,  // same as name:name
  age: 30
};
```


## Property names limitations

As we already know, a variable cannot have a name equal to one of language-reserved words like "for", "let", "return" etc.

But for an object property, there's no such restriction:

```js run
// these properties are all right
let obj = {
  for: 1,
  let: 2,
  return: 3
};

alert( obj.for + obj.let + obj.return );  // 6
```

In short, there are no limitations on property names. They can be any strings or symbols (a special type for identifiers, to be covered later).

Other types are automatically converted to strings.

For instance, a number `0` becomes a string `"0"` when used as a property key:

```js run
let obj = {
  0: "test" // same as "0": "test"
};

// both alerts access the same property (the number 0 is converted to string "0")
alert( obj["0"] ); // test
alert( obj[0] ); // test (same property)
```

There's a minor gotcha with a special property named `__proto__`. We can't set it to a non-object value:

```js run
let obj = {};
obj.__proto__ = 5; // assign a number
alert(obj.__proto__); // [object Object] - the value is an object, didn't work as intended
```

As we see from the code, the assignment to a primitive `5` is ignored.

We'll cover the special nature of `__proto__` in [subsequent chapters](info:prototype-inheritance), and suggest the [ways to fix](info:prototype-methods) such behavior.

## Property existence test, "in" operator

A notable feature of objects in JavaScript, compared to many other languages, is that it's possible to access any property. There will be no error if the property doesn't exist!

Reading a non-existing property just returns `undefined`. So we can easily test whether the property exists:

```js run
let user = {};

alert( user.noSuchProperty === undefined ); // true means "no such property"
```

There's also a special operator `"in"` for that.

The syntax is:
```js
"key" in object
```

For instance:

```js run
let user = { name: "John", age: 30 };

alert( "age" in user ); // true, user.age exists
alert( "blabla" in user ); // false, user.blabla doesn't exist
```

Please note that on the left side of `in` there must be a *property name*. That's usually a quoted string.

If we omit quotes, that means a variable, it should contain the actual name to be tested. For instance:

```js run
let user = { age: 30 };

let key = "age";
alert( *!*key*/!* in user ); // true, property "age" exists
```

Why does the `in` operator exist? Isn't it enough to compare against `undefined`?

Well, most of the time the comparison with `undefined` works fine. But there's a special case when it fails, but `"in"` works correctly.

It's when an object property exists, but stores `undefined`:

```js run
let obj = {
  test: undefined
};

alert( obj.test ); // it's undefined, so - no such property?

alert( "test" in obj ); // true, the property does exist!
```

In the code above, the property `obj.test` technically exists. So the `in` operator works right.

Situations like this happen very rarely, because `undefined` should not be explicitly assigned. We mostly use `null` for "unknown" or "empty" values. So the `in` operator is an exotic guest in the code.


## The "for..in" loop

To walk over all keys of an object, there exists a special form of the loop: `for..in`. This is a completely different thing from the `for(;;)` construct that we studied before.

The syntax:

```js
for (key in object) {
  // executes the body for each key among object properties
}
```

For instance, let's output all properties of `user`:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: true
};

for (let key in user) {
  // keys
  alert( key );  // name, age, isAdmin
  // values for the keys
  alert( user[key] ); // John, 30, true
}
```

Note that all "for" constructs allow us to declare the looping variable inside the loop, like `let key` here.

Also, we could use another variable name here instead of `key`. For instance, `"for (let prop in obj)"` is also widely used.

### Ordered like an object

Are objects ordered? In other words, if we loop over an object, do we get all properties in the same order they were added? Can we rely on this?

The short answer is: "ordered in a special fashion": integer properties are sorted, others appear in creation order. The details follow.

As an example, let's consider an object with the phone codes:

```js run
let codes = {
  "49": "Germany",
  "41": "Switzerland",
  "44": "Great Britain",
  // ..,
  "1": "USA"
};

*!*
for (let code in codes) {
  alert(code); // 1, 41, 44, 49
}
*/!*
```

The object may be used to suggest a list of options to the user. If we're making a site mainly for German audience then we probably want `49` to be the first.

But if we run the code, we see a totally different picture:

- USA (1) goes first
- then Switzerland (41) and so on.

The phone codes go in the ascending sorted order, because they are integers. So we see `1, 41, 44, 49`.

````smart header="Integer properties? What's that?"
The "integer property" term here means a string that can be converted to-and-from an integer without a change.

So, "49" is an integer property name, because when it's transformed to an integer number and back, it's still the same. But "+49" and "1.2" are not:

```js run
// Math.trunc is a built-in function that removes the decimal part
alert( String(Math.trunc(Number("49"))) ); // "49", same, integer property
alert( String(Math.trunc(Number("+49"))) ); // "49", not same "+49" ⇒ not integer property
alert( String(Math.trunc(Number("1.2"))) ); // "1", not same "1.2" ⇒ not integer property
```
````

...On the other hand, if the keys are non-integer, then they are listed in the creation order, for instance:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  surname: "Smith"
};
user.age = 25; // add one more

*!*
// non-integer properties are listed in the creation order
*/!*
for (let prop in user) {
  alert( prop ); // name, surname, age
}
```

So, to fix the issue with the phone codes, we can "cheat" by making the codes non-integer. Adding a plus `"+"` sign before each code is enough.

Like this:

```js run
let codes = {
  "+49": "Germany",
  "+41": "Switzerland",
  "+44": "Great Britain",
  // ..,
  "+1": "USA"
};

for (let code in codes) {
  alert( +code ); // 49, 41, 44, 1
}
```

Now it works as intended.

## Summary

Objects are associative arrays with several special features.

They store properties (key-value pairs), where:
- Property keys must be strings or symbols (usually strings).
- Values can be of any type.

To access a property, we can use:
- The dot notation: `obj.property`.
- Square brackets notation `obj["property"]`. Square brackets allow to take the key from a variable, like `obj[varWithKey]`.

Additional operators:
- To delete a property: `delete obj.prop`.
- To check if a property with the given key exists: `"key" in obj`.
- To iterate over an object: `for (let key in obj)` loop.

What we've studied in this chapter is called a "plain object", or just `Object`.

There are many other kinds of objects in JavaScript:

- `Array` to store ordered data collections,
- `Date` to store the information about the date and time,
- `Error` to store the information about an error.
- ...And so on.

They have their special features that we'll study later. Sometimes people say something like "Array type" or "Date type", but formally they are not types of their own, but belong to a single "object" data type. And they extend it in various ways.

Objects in JavaScript are very powerful. Here we've just scratched the surface of a topic that is really huge. We'll be closely working with objects and learning more about them in further parts of the tutorial.

# Object references and copying

One of the fundamental differences of objects versus primitives is that objects are stored and copied "by reference", whereas primitive values: strings, numbers, booleans, etc -- are always copied "as a whole value".

That's easy to understand if we look a bit under the hood of what happens when we copy a value.

Let's start with a primitive, such as a string.

Here we put a copy of `message` into `phrase`:

```js
let message = "Hello!";
let phrase = message;
```

As a result we have two independent variables, each one storing the string `"Hello!"`.

![](variable-copy-value.svg)

Quite an obvious result, right?

Objects are not like that.

**A variable assigned to an object stores not the object itself, but its "address in memory" -- in other words "a reference" to it.**

Let's look at an example of such a variable:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John"
};
```

And here's how it's actually stored in memory:

![](variable-contains-reference.svg)

The object is stored somewhere in memory (at the right of the picture), while the `user` variable (at the left) has a "reference" to it.

We may think of an object variable, such as `user`, as like a sheet of paper with the address of the object on it.

When we perform actions with the object, e.g. take a property `user.name`, the JavaScript engine looks at what's at that address and performs the operation on the actual object.

Now here's why it's important.

**When an object variable is copied, the reference is copied, but the object itself is not duplicated.**

For instance:

```js no-beautify
let user = { name: "John" };

let admin = user; // copy the reference
```

Now we have two variables, each storing a reference to the same object:

![](variable-copy-reference.svg)

As you can see, there's still one object, but now with two variables that reference it.

We can use either variable to access the object and modify its contents:

```js run
let user = { name: 'John' };

let admin = user;

*!*
admin.name = 'Pete'; // changed by the "admin" reference
*/!*

alert(*!*user.name*/!*); // 'Pete', changes are seen from the "user" reference
```

It's as if we had a cabinet with two keys and used one of them (`admin`) to get into it and make changes. Then, if we later use another key (`user`), we are still opening the same cabinet and can access the changed contents.

## Comparison by reference

Two objects are equal only if they are the same object.

For instance, here `a` and `b` reference the same object, thus they are equal:

```js run
let a = {};
let b = a; // copy the reference

alert( a == b ); // true, both variables reference the same object
alert( a === b ); // true
```

And here two independent objects are not equal, even though they look alike (both are empty):

```js run
let a = {};
let b = {}; // two independent objects

alert( a == b ); // false
```

For comparisons like `obj1 > obj2` or for a comparison against a primitive `obj == 5`, objects are converted to primitives. We'll study how object conversions work very soon, but to tell the truth, such comparisons are needed very rarely -- usually they appear as a result of a programming mistake.

## Cloning and merging, Object.assign [#cloning-and-merging-object-assign]

So, copying an object variable creates one more reference to the same object.

But what if we need to duplicate an object? Create an independent copy, a clone?

That's also doable, but a little bit more difficult, because there's no built-in method for that in JavaScript. But there is rarely a need -- copying by reference is good most of the time.

But if we really want that, then we need to create a new object and replicate the structure of the existing one by iterating over its properties and copying them on the primitive level.

Like this:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

*!*
let clone = {}; // the new empty object

// let's copy all user properties into it
for (let key in user) {
  clone[key] = user[key];
}
*/!*

// now clone is a fully independent object with the same content
clone.name = "Pete"; // changed the data in it

alert( user.name ); // still John in the original object
```

Also we can use the method [Object.assign](mdn:js/Object/assign) for that.

The syntax is:

```js
Object.assign(dest, [src1, src2, src3...])
```

- The first argument `dest` is a target object.
- Further arguments `src1, ..., srcN` (can be as many as needed) are source objects.
- It copies the properties of all source objects `src1, ..., srcN` into the target `dest`. In other words, properties of all arguments starting from the second are copied into the first object.
- The call returns `dest`.

For instance, we can use it to merge several objects into one:
```js
let user = { name: "John" };

let permissions1 = { canView: true };
let permissions2 = { canEdit: true };

*!*
// copies all properties from permissions1 and permissions2 into user
Object.assign(user, permissions1, permissions2);
*/!*

// now user = { name: "John", canView: true, canEdit: true }
```

If the copied property name already exists, it gets overwritten:

```js run
let user = { name: "John" };

Object.assign(user, { name: "Pete" });

alert(user.name); // now user = { name: "Pete" }
```

We also can use `Object.assign` to replace `for..in` loop for simple cloning:

```js
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

*!*
let clone = Object.assign({}, user);
*/!*
```

It copies all properties of `user` into the empty object and returns it.

There are also other methods of cloning an object, e.g. using the [spread syntax](info:rest-parameters-spread) `clone = {...user}`, covered later in the tutorial.

## Nested cloning

Until now we assumed that all properties of `user` are primitive. But properties can be references to other objects. What to do with them?

Like this:
```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  sizes: {
    height: 182,
    width: 50
  }
};

alert( user.sizes.height ); // 182
```

Now it's not enough to copy `clone.sizes = user.sizes`, because the `user.sizes` is an object, it will be copied by reference. So `clone` and `user` will share the same sizes:

Like this:

```js run
let user = {
  name: "John",
  sizes: {
    height: 182,
    width: 50
  }
};

let clone = Object.assign({}, user);

alert( user.sizes === clone.sizes ); // true, same object

// user and clone share sizes
user.sizes.width++;       // change a property from one place
alert(clone.sizes.width); // 51, see the result from the other one
```

To fix that, we should use a cloning loop that examines each value of `user[key]` and, if it's an object, then replicate its structure as well. That is called a "deep cloning".

We can use recursion to implement it. Or, to not reinvent the wheel, take an existing implementation, for instance [_.cloneDeep(obj)](https://lodash.com/docs#cloneDeep) from the JavaScript library [lodash](https://lodash.com).

````smart header="Const objects can be modified"
An important side effect of storing objects as references is that an object declared as `const` *can* be modified.

For instance:

```js run
const user = {
  name: "John"
};

*!*
user.name = "Pete"; // (*)
*/!*

alert(user.name); // Pete
```

It might seem that the line `(*)` would cause an error, but it does not. The value of `user` is constant, it must always reference the same object, but properties of that object are free to change.

In other words, the `const user` gives an error only if we try to set `user=...` as a whole.

That said, if we really need to make constant object properties, it's also possible, but using totally different methods. We'll mention that in the chapter <info:property-descriptors>.
````

## Summary

Objects are assigned and copied by reference. In other words, a variable stores not the "object value", but a "reference" (address in memory) for the value. So copying such a variable or passing it as a function argument copies that reference, not the object itself.

All operations via copied references (like adding/removing properties) are performed on the same single object.

To make a "real copy" (a clone) we can use `Object.assign` for the so-called "shallow copy" (nested objects are copied by reference) or a "deep cloning" function, such as [_.cloneDeep(obj)](https://lodash.com/docs#cloneDeep).


# Garbage collection

Memory management in JavaScript is performed automatically and invisibly to us. We create primitives, objects, functions… All that takes memory.

What happens when something is not needed any more? How does the JavaScript engine discover it and clean it up?

Reachability

The main concept of memory management in JavaScript is reachability.

Simply put, “reachable” values are those that are accessible or usable somehow. They are guaranteed to be stored in memory.

1. There’s a base set of inherently reachable values, that cannot be deleted for obvious reasons.

For instance:

The currently executing function, its local variables and parameters.
Other functions on the current chain of nested calls, their local variables and parameters.
Global variables.
(there are some other, internal ones as well)
These values are called roots.

2. Any other value is considered reachable if it’s reachable from a root by a reference or by a chain of references.

For instance, if there’s an object in a global variable, and that object has a property referencing another object, that object is considered reachable. And those that it references are also reachable. Detailed examples to follow.

There’s a background process in the JavaScript engine that is called garbage collector (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science). It monitors all objects and removes those that have become unreachable.

A simple example

Here’s the simplest example:

// user has a reference to the object
let user = {
  name: "John"
};

Here the arrow depicts an object reference. The global variable "user" references the object {name: "John"} (we’ll call it John for brevity). The "name" property of John stores a primitive, so it’s painted inside the object.

If the value of user is overwritten, the reference is lost:

user = null;

Now John becomes unreachable. There’s no way to access it, no references to it. Garbage collector will junk the data and free the memory.

Two references
Now let’s imagine we copied the reference from user to admin:

// user has a reference to the object
let user = {
  name: "John"
};

let admin = user;

Now if we do the same:

user = null;

…Then the object is still reachable via admin global variable, so it’s in memory. If we overwrite admin too, then it can be removed.

Interlinked objects
Now a more complex example. The family:

function marry(man, woman) {
  woman.husband = man;
  man.wife = woman;

  return {
    father: man,
    mother: woman
  }
}

let family = marry({
  name: "John"
}, {
  name: "Ann"
});

Function marry “marries” two objects by giving them references to each other and returns a new object that contains them both.

The resulting memory structure:
As of now, all objects are reachable.

Now let’s remove two references:

delete family.father;
delete family.mother.husband;
It’s not enough to delete only one of these two references, because all objects would still be reachable.

But if we delete both, then we can see that John has no incoming reference any more:
Outgoing references do not matter. Only incoming ones can make an object reachable. So, John is now unreachable and will be removed from the memory with all its data that also became unaccessible.

After garbage collection:

# Object methods and this keyword

Objects are usually created to represent entities of the real world, like users, orders and so on:

let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

And, in the real world, a user can act: select something from the shopping cart, login, logout etc.

Actions are represented in JavaScript by functions in properties.

Method examples
For a start, let’s teach the user to say hello:

let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

user.sayHi = function() {
  alert("Hello!");
};

user.sayHi(); // Hello!

Here we’ve just used a Function Expression to create a function and assign it to the property user.sayHi of the object.

Then we can call it as user.sayHi(). The user can now speak!

A function that is a property of an object is called its method.

So, here we’ve got a method sayHi of the object user.

Of course, we could use a pre-declared function as a method, like this:

let user = {
  // ...
};

// first, declare
function sayHi() {
  alert("Hello!");
};

// then add as a method
user.sayHi = sayHi;

user.sayHi(); // Hello!
Info:
Object-oriented programming
When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that’s called object-oriented programming, in short: “OOP”.

OOP is a big thing, an interesting science of its own. How to choose the right entities? How to organize the interaction between them? That’s architecture, and there are great books on that topic, like “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software” by E. Gamma, R. Helm, R. Johnson, J. Vissides or “Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications” by G. Booch, and more.

Method shorthand
There exists a shorter syntax for methods in an object literal:

// these objects do the same

user = {
  sayHi: function() {
    alert("Hello");
  }
};

// method shorthand looks better, right?
user = {
  sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function(){...}"
    alert("Hello");
  }
};

As demonstrated, we can omit "function" and just write sayHi().

To tell the truth, the notations are not fully identical. There are subtle differences related to object inheritance (to be covered later), but for now they do not matter. In almost all cases the shorter syntax is preferred.

“this” in methods
It’s common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job.

For instance, the code inside user.sayHi() may need the name of the user.

To access the object, a method can use the this keyword.

The value of this is the object “before dot”, the one used to call the method.

For instance:

let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,

  sayHi() {
    // "this" is the "current object"
    alert(this.name);
  }

};

user.sayHi(); // John

Here during the execution of user.sayHi(), the value of this will be user.

Technically, it’s also possible to access the object without this, by referencing it via the outer variable:



let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,

  sayHi() {
    alert(user.name); // "user" instead of "this"
  }

};

…But such code is unreliable. If we decide to copy user to another variable, e.g. admin = user and overwrite user with something else, then it will access the wrong object.

That’s demonstrated below:

let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,

  sayHi() {
    alert( user.name ); // leads to an error
  }

};


let admin = user;
user = null; // overwrite to make things obvious

admin.sayHi(); // TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null

If we used this.name instead of user.name inside the alert, then the code would work.

“this” is not bound
In JavaScript, keyword this behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if it’s not a method of an object.

There’s no syntax error in the following example:

function sayHi() {
  alert( this.name );
}

The value of this is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context.

For instance, here the same function is assigned to two different objects and has different “this” in the calls:



let user = { name: "John" };
let admin = { name: "Admin" };

function sayHi() {
  alert( this.name );
}

// use the same function in two objects
user.f = sayHi;
admin.f = sayHi;

// these calls have different this
// "this" inside the function is the object "before the dot"
user.f(); // John  (this == user)
admin.f(); // Admin  (this == admin)

admin['f'](); // Admin (dot or square brackets access the method – doesn't matter)

The rule is simple: if obj.f() is called, then this is obj during the call of f. So it’s either user or admin in the example above.
Info:
Calling without an object: this == undefined

We can even call the function without an object at all:

function sayHi() {
  alert(this);
}

sayHi(); // undefined

In this case this is undefined in strict mode. If we try to access this.name, there will be an error.

In non-strict mode the value of this in such case will be the global object (window in a browser, we’ll get to it later in the chapter Global object). This is a historical behavior that "use strict" fixes.

Usually such call is a programming error. If there’s this inside a function, it expects to be called in an object context.

Info:
The consequences of unbound this

If you come from another programming language, then you are probably used to the idea of a "bound this", where methods defined in an object always have this referencing that object.

In JavaScript this is “free”, its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method was declared, but rather on what object is “before the dot”.

The concept of run-time evaluated this has both pluses and minuses. On the one hand, a function can be reused for different objects. On the other hand, the greater flexibility creates more possibilities for mistakes.

Here our position is not to judge whether this language design decision is good or bad. We’ll understand how to work with it, how to get benefits and avoid problems.

Arrow functions have no “this”

Arrow functions are special: they don’t have their “own” this. If we reference this from such a function, it’s taken from the outer “normal” function.

For instance, here arrow() uses this from the outer user.sayHi() method:

let user = {
  firstName: "Ilya",
  sayHi() {
    let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
    arrow();
  }
};

user.sayHi(); // Ilya

That’s a special feature of arrow functions, it’s useful when we actually do not want to have a separate this, but rather to take it from the outer context. Later in the chapter Arrow functions revisited (https://javascript.info/arrow-functions) we’ll go more deeply into arrow functions.

Summary

Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.
Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().
Methods can reference the object as this.

The value of this is defined at run-time.

When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is called.
A function can be copied between objects.
When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the call is object.

Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no this. When this is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from outside.



# Constructor, operator "new"

The regular {...} syntax allows to create one object. But often we need to create many similar objects, like multiple users or menu items and so on.

That can be done using constructor functions and the "new" operator.

Constructor function
Constructor functions technically are regular functions. There are two conventions though:

1. They are named with capital letter first.
2. They should be executed only with "new" operator.

For instance:

function User(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.isAdmin = false;
}

let user = new User("Jack");

alert(user.name); // Jack
alert(user.isAdmin); // false

When a function is executed with new, it does the following steps:

1. A new empty object is created and assigned to this.
2. The function body executes. Usually it modifies this, adds new properties to it.
3. The value of this is returned.

In other words, new User(...) does something like:

function User(name) {
  // this = {};  (implicitly)

  // add properties to this
  this.name = name;
  this.isAdmin = false;

  // return this;  (implicitly)
}

So let user = new User("Jack") gives the same result as:

let user = {
  name: "Jack",
  isAdmin: false
};

Now if we want to create other users, we can call new User("Ann"), new User("Alice") and so on. Much shorter than using literals every time, and also easy to read.

That’s the main purpose of constructors – to implement reusable object creation code.

Let’s note once again – technically, any function (except arrow functions, as they don’t have this) can be used as a constructor. It can be run with new, and it will execute the algorithm above. The “capital letter first” is a common agreement, to make it clear that a function is to be run with new.

Info: new function() { … }
If we have many lines of code all about creation of a single complex object, we can wrap them in an immediately called constructor function, like this:

let user = new function() {
  this.name = "John";
  this.isAdmin = false;

  // ...other code for user creation
  // maybe complex logic and statements
  // local variables etc
};

This constructor can’t be called again, because it is not saved anywhere, just created and called. So this trick aims to encapsulate the code that constructs the single object, without future reuse.

Constructor mode test: new.target

Info: Advanced stuff
The syntax from this section is rarely used, skip it unless you want to know everything.

Inside a function, we can check whether it was called with new or without it, using a special new.target property.

It is undefined for regular calls and equals the function if called with new:

function User() {
  alert(new.target);
}

// without "new":
User(); // undefined

// with "new":
new User(); // function User { ... }

That can be used inside the function to know whether it was called with new, “in constructor mode”, or without it, “in regular mode”.

We can also make both new and regular calls to do the same, like this:

function User(name) {
  if (!new.target) { // if you run me without new
    return new User(name); // ...I will add new for you
  }

  this.name = name;
}

let john = User("John"); // redirects call to new User
alert(john.name); // John

This approach is sometimes used in libraries to make the syntax more flexible. So that people may call the function with or without new, and it still works.

Probably not a good thing to use everywhere though, because omitting new makes it a bit less obvious what’s going on. With new we all know that the new object is being created.

Return from constructors
Usually, constructors do not have a return statement. Their task is to write all necessary stuff into this, and it automatically becomes the result.

But if there is a return statement, then the rule is simple:

* If return is called with an object, then the object is returned instead of this.
* If return is called with a primitive, it’s ignored.

In other words, return with an object returns that object, in all other cases this is returned.

For instance, here return overrides this by returning an object:

function BigUser() {

  this.name = "John";

  return { name: "Godzilla" };  // <-- returns this object
}

alert( new BigUser().name );  // Godzilla, got that object

And here’s an example with an empty return (or we could place a primitive after it, doesn’t matter):

function SmallUser() {

  this.name = "John";

  return; // <-- returns this
}

alert( new SmallUser().name );  // John

Usually constructors don’t have a return statement. Here we mention the special behavior with returning objects mainly for the sake of completeness.

Info: Omitting parentheses
By the way, we can omit parentheses after new, if it has no arguments:

let user = new User; // <-- no parentheses
// same as
let user = new User();
Omitting parentheses here is not considered a “good style”, but the syntax is permitted by specification.

Methods in constructor
Using constructor functions to create objects gives a great deal of flexibility. The constructor function may have parameters that define how to construct the object, and what to put in it.

Of course, we can add to this not only properties, but methods as well.

For instance, new User(name) below creates an object with the given name and the method sayHi:

function User(name) {
  this.name = name;

  this.sayHi = function() {
    alert( "My name is: " + this.name );
  };
}

let john = new User("John");

john.sayHi(); // My name is: John

/*
john = {
   name: "John",
   sayHi: function() { ... }
}
*/

To create complex objects, there’s a more advanced syntax, classes, that we’ll cover later.

Summary
Constructor functions or, briefly, constructors, are regular functions, but there’s a common agreement to name them with capital letter first.
Constructor functions should only be called using new. Such a call implies a creation of empty this at the start and returning the populated one at the end.
We can use constructor functions to make multiple similar objects.

JavaScript provides constructor functions for many built-in language objects: like Date for dates, Set for sets and others that we plan to study.

Info: Objects, we’ll be back!
In this chapter we only cover the basics about objects and constructors. They are essential for learning more about data types and functions in the next chapters.

After we learn that, we return to objects and cover them in-depth in the chapters Prototypes, inheritance and Classes.

# Optional chaining '?.'

Warn: A recent addition
This is a recent addition to the language. Old browsers may need polyfills.

The optional chaining ?. is a safe way to access nested object properties, even if an intermediate property doesn’t exist.

The “non-existing property” problem
If you’ve just started to read the tutorial and learn JavaScript, maybe the problem hasn’t touched you yet, but it’s quite common.

As an example, let’s say we have user objects that hold the information about our users.

Most of our users have addresses in user.address property, with the street user.address.street, but some did not provide them.

In such case, when we attempt to get user.address.street, and the user happens to be without an address, we get an error:

let user = {}; // a user without "address" property

alert(user.address.street); // Error!

That’s the expected result. JavaScript works like this. As user.address is undefined, an attempt to get user.address.street fails with an error.

In many practical cases we’d prefer to get undefined instead of an error here (meaning “no street”).

…And another example. In the web development, we can get an object that corresponds to a web page element using a special method call, such as document.querySelector('.elem'), and it returns null when there’s no such element.

// document.querySelector('.elem') is null if there's no element
let html = document.querySelector('.elem').innerHTML; // error if it's null

Once again, if the element doesn’t exist, we’ll get an error accessing .innerHTML of null. And in some cases, when the absence of the element is normal, we’d like to avoid the error and just accept html = null as the result.

How can we do this?

The obvious solution would be to check the value using if or the conditional operator ?, before accessing its property, like this:

let user = {};

alert(user.address ? user.address.street : undefined);

It works, there’s no error… But it’s quite inelegant. As you can see, the "user.address" appears twice in the code. For more deeply nested properties, that becomes a problem as more repetitions are required.

E.g. let’s try getting user.address.street.name.

We need to check both user.address and user.address.street:

let user = {}; // user has no address

alert(user.address ? user.address.street ? user.address.street.name : null : null);

That’s just awful, one may even have problems understanding such code.

Don’t even care to, as there’s a better way to write it, using the && operator:

let user = {}; // user has no address

alert( user.address && user.address.street && user.address.street.name ); // undefined (no error)

AND’ing the whole path to the property ensures that all components exist (if not, the evaluation stops), but also isn’t ideal.

As you can see, property names are still duplicated in the code. E.g. in the code above, user.address appears three times.

That’s why the optional chaining ?. was added to the language. To solve this problem once and for all!

Optional chaining
The optional chaining ?. stops the evaluation if the value before ?. is undefined or null and returns undefined.

Further in this article, for brevity, we’ll be saying that something “exists” if it’s not null and not undefined.

In other words, value?.prop:

* works as value.prop, if value exists,
* otherwise (when value is undefined/null) it returns undefined.

Here’s the safe way to access user.address.street using ?.:

let user = {}; // user has no address

alert( user?.address?.street ); // undefined (no error)

The code is short and clean, there’s no duplication at all.

Reading the address with user?.address works even if user object doesn’t exist:

let user = null;

alert( user?.address ); // undefined
alert( user?.address.street ); // undefined

Please note: the ?. syntax makes optional the value before it, but not any further.


# Symbol Type

By specification, object property keys may be either of string type, or of symbol type. Not numbers, not booleans, only strings or symbols, these two types.

Till now we’ve been using only strings. Now let’s see the benefits that symbols can give us.

Symbols

A “symbol” represents a unique identifier.

A value of this type can be created using Symbol():

// id is a new symbol
let id = Symbol();

Upon creation, we can give symbol a description (also called a symbol name), mostly useful for debugging purposes:

// id is a symbol with the description "id"
let id = Symbol("id");

Symbols are guaranteed to be unique. Even if we create many symbols with the same description, they are different values. The description is just a label that doesn’t affect anything.

For instance, here are two symbols with the same description – they are not equal:

let id1 = Symbol("id");
let id2 = Symbol("id");

alert(id1 == id2); // false

If you are familiar with Ruby or another language that also has some sort of “symbols” – please don’t be misguided. JavaScript symbols are different.

Warn: Symbols don’t auto-convert to a string
Most values in JavaScript support implicit conversion to a string. For instance, we can alert almost any value, and it will work. Symbols are special. They don’t auto-convert.

For instance, this alert will show an error:

let id = Symbol("id");
alert(id); // TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string

That’s a “language guard” against messing up, because strings and symbols are fundamentally different and should not accidentally convert one into another.

If we really want to show a symbol, we need to explicitly call .toString() on it, like here:

let id = Symbol("id");
alert(id.toString()); // Symbol(id), now it works

Or get symbol.description property to show the description only:

let id = Symbol("id");
alert(id.description); // id

# Object to primitive conversion

What happens when objects are added obj1 + obj2, subtracted obj1 - obj2 or printed using alert(obj)?

JavaScript doesn’t exactly allow to customize how operators work on objects. Unlike some other programming languages, such as Ruby or C++, we can’t implement a special object method to handle an addition (or other operators).

In case of such operations, objects are auto-converted to primitives, and then the operation is carried out over these primitives and results in a primitive value.

That’s an important limitation, as the result of obj1 + obj2 can’t be another object!

E.g. we can’t make objects representing vectors or matrices (or archievements or whatever), add them and expect a “summed” object as the result. Such architectural feats are automatically “off the board”.

So, because we can’t do much here, there’s no maths with objects in real projects. When it happens, it’s usually because of a coding mistake.

In this chapter we’ll cover how an object converts to primitive and how to customize it.

We have two purposes:

1. It will allow us to understand what’s going on in case of coding mistakes, when such an operation happened accidentally.
2. There are exceptions, where such operations are possible and look good. E.g. subtracting or comparing dates (Date objects). We’ll come across them later.

Conversion rules
In the chapter Type Conversions (https://javascript.info/type-conversions) we’ve seen the rules for numeric, string and boolean conversions of primitives. But we left a gap for objects. Now, as we know about methods and symbols it becomes possible to fill it.

1. All objects are true in a boolean context. There are only numeric and string conversions.
2. The numeric conversion happens when we subtract objects or apply mathematical functions. For instance, Date objects (to be covered in the chapter Date and time) can be subtracted, and the result of date1 - date2 is the time difference between two dates.
3. As for the string conversion – it usually happens when we output an object like alert(obj) and in similar contexts.

We can fine-tune string and numeric conversion, using special object methods.

There are three variants of type conversion, that happen in various situations.

They’re called “hints”, as described in the specification:(https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-toprimitive)

"string"

For an object-to-string conversion, when we’re doing an operation on an object that expects a string, like alert:

// output
alert(obj);

// using object as a property key
anotherObj[obj] = 123;

"number"
For an object-to-number conversion, like when we’re doing maths:

// explicit conversion
let num = Number(obj);

// maths (except binary plus)
let n = +obj; // unary plus
let delta = date1 - date2;

// less/greater comparison
let greater = user1 > user2;

"default"
Occurs in rare cases when the operator is “not sure” what type to expect.

For instance, binary plus + can work both with strings (concatenates them) and numbers (adds them), so both strings and numbers would do. So if a binary plus gets an object as an argument, it uses the "default" hint to convert it.

Also, if an object is compared using == with a string, number or a symbol, it’s also unclear which conversion should be done, so the "default" hint is used.

// binary plus uses the "default" hint
let total = obj1 + obj2;

// obj == number uses the "default" hint
if (user == 1) { ... };

The greater and less comparison operators, such as < >, can work with both strings and numbers too. Still, they use the "number" hint, not "default". That’s for historical reasons.

In practice though, we don’t need to remember these peculiar details, because all built-in objects except for one case (Date object, we’ll learn it later) implement "default" conversion the same way as "number". And we can do the same.

Info: No "boolean" hint
Please note – there are only three hints. It’s that simple.

There is no “boolean” hint (all objects are true in boolean context) or anything else. And if we treat "default" and "number" the same, like most built-ins do, then there are only two conversions.

To do the conversion, JavaScript tries to find and call three object methods:

1. Call obj[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint) – the method with the symbolic key Symbol.toPrimitive (system symbol), if such method exists,
2. Otherwise if hint is "string"
try obj.toString() and obj.valueOf(), whatever exists.
3. Otherwise if hint is "number" or "default"
try obj.valueOf() and obj.toString(), whatever exists.
