You'll be using the command line, also known as the terminal. On Windows, you can access it by running Command Prompt from the Start menu; on a Mac, hit Cmd and Space together to bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal.app. On most Linux systems, `Ctrl-Alt-T` brings up the command line.

A full introduction to the command line is out of the scope of this guide, but here are a few more useful commands:

- cd .. 

navigates to the parent of the current directory

- cat my-file.txt 

on Mac/Linux (type my-file.txt on Windows), lists the contents of my-file.txt

- open . (or start . on Windows) --*FIXME - anlaşılmadı

opens the current directory in Finder or File Explorer
