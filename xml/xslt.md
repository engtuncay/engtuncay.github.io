# XSLT Introduction

XSL (eXtensible Stylesheet Language) is a styling language for XML.

XSLT stands for XSL Transformations.

This tutorial will teach you how to use XSLT to transform XML documents into other formats (like transforming XML into HTML).

## Online XSLT Editor

With W3C online editor, you can edit XML and XSLT code, and click on a button to view the result.

XSLT Example

```XML
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

<xsl:template match="/">
  <html>
  <body>
    <h2>My CD Collection</h2>
    <table border="1">
      <tr bgcolor="#9acd32">
        <th>Title</th>
        <th>Artist</th>
      </tr>
      <xsl:for-each select="catalog/cd">
        <tr>
          <td><xsl:value-of select="title"/></td>
          <td><xsl:value-of select="artist"/></td>
        </tr>
      </xsl:for-each>
    </table>
  </body>
  </html>
</xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>

```

## XSLT References

XSLT Elements : https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xsl_elementref.asp

Description of all the XSLT elements from the W3C Recommendation, and information about browser support.

XSLT, XPath, and XQuery Functions : https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xsl_functions.asp

XSLT 2.0, XPath 2.0, and XQuery 1.0, share the same functions library. There are over 100 built-in functions. There are functions for string values, numeric values, date and time comparison, node and QName manipulation, sequence manipulation, and more.

# XSL(T) Languages
XSLT is a language for transforming XML documents.

XPath is a language for navigating in XML documents.

XQuery is a language for querying XML documents.

üîî It Started with XSL

XSL stands for EXtensible Stylesheet Language.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) started to develop XSL because there was a need for an XML-based Stylesheet Language.

üîî CSS = Style Sheets for HTML

HTML uses predefined tags. The meaning of, and how to display each tag is well understood.

CSS is used to add styles to HTML elements. 

üîî XSL = Style Sheets for XML

XML does not use predefined tags, and therefore the meaning of each tag is not well understood.

A `<table>` element could indicate an HTML table, a piece of furniture, or something else - and browsers do not know how to display it!

So, XSL describes how the XML elements should be displayed.

üîî XSL - More Than a Style Sheet Language

XSL consists of four parts:

- XSLT - a language for transforming XML documents
- XPath - a language for navigating in XML documents
- XSL-FO - a language for formatting XML documents (discontinued in 2013)
- XQuery - a language for querying XML documents

‚úè Note : With the CSS3 Paged Media Module, W3C has delivered a new standard for document formatting. So, since 2013, CSS3 is proposed as an XSL-FO replacement.

üîî What is XSLT?

- XSLT stands for XSL Transformations
- XSLT is the most important part of XSL
- XSLT transforms an XML document into another XML document
- XSLT uses XPath to navigate in XML documents
- XSLT is a W3C Recommendation

üîî XSLT = XSL Transformations ‚ùó 

XSLT is the most important part of XSL.

XSLT is used to transform an XML document into another XML document, or another type of document that is recognized by a browser, like HTML and XHTML. Normally XSLT does this by transforming each XML element into an (X)HTML element.

With XSLT you can add/remove elements and attributes to or from the output file. You can also rearrange and sort elements, perform tests and make decisions about which elements to hide and display, and a lot more.

A common way to describe the transformation process is to say that XSLT transforms an XML <span style="color:red">source-tree</span> into an XML <span style="color:red">result-tree</span>.

üîî XSLT Uses XPath

XSLT uses *XPath* to find information in an XML document. XPath is used to navigate through elements and attributes in XML documents.

üîî How Does it Work?

In the transformation process, XSLT uses *XPath* to define parts of the source document that should match one or more predefined templates. When a match is found, XSLT will transform the matching part of the source document into the result document.

üîî XSLT Browser Support

All major browsers support XSLT and XPath.

üîî XSLT is a W3C Recommendation

XSLT became a W3C Recommendation 16. November 1999. (https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt/all/)

The details of this example will be explained in the next chapter.

üîî Correct Style Sheet Declaration

The root element that declares the document to be an XSL style sheet is `<xsl:stylesheet>` or `<xsl:transform>`.

‚ùó Note: `<xsl:stylesheet>` and `<xsl:transform>` are completely synonymous and either can be used!

The correct way to declare an XSL style sheet according to the W3C XSLT Recommendation is:

```xml
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

or:

<xsl:transform version="1.0"
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

```

To get access to the XSLT elements, attributes and features we must declare the XSLT namespace at the top of the document.

The xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" points to the official W3C XSLT namespace. If you use this namespace, you must also include the attribute version="1.0".

Start with a Raw XML Document
We want to transform the following XML document ("cdcatalog.xml") into XHTML:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<catalog>
  <cd>
    <title>Empire Burlesque</title>
    <artist>Bob Dylan</artist>
    <country>USA</country>
    <company>Columbia</company>
    <price>10.90</price>
    <year>1985</year>
  </cd>
.
.
</catalog>
Viewing XML Files in browsers: Open the XML file (click on the link below) - The XML document will be displayed with color-coded root and child elements. Often, there is an arrow or plus/minus sign to the left of the elements that can be clicked to expand or collapse the element structure. Tip: To view the raw XML source, right-click in XML file and select "View Page Source"!

View "cdcatalog.xml"

Create an XSL Style Sheet
Then you create an XSL Style Sheet ("cdcatalog.xsl") with a transformation template:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

<xsl:template match="/">
  <html>
  <body>
  <h2>My CD Collection</h2>
  <table border="1">
    <tr bgcolor="#9acd32">
      <th>Title</th>
      <th>Artist</th>
    </tr>
    <xsl:for-each select="catalog/cd">
    <tr>
      <td><xsl:value-of select="title"/></td>
      <td><xsl:value-of select="artist"/></td>
    </tr>
    </xsl:for-each>
  </table>
  </body>
  </html>
</xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>
View "cdcatalog.xsl"

Link the XSL Style Sheet to the XML Document
Add the XSL style sheet reference to your XML document ("cdcatalog.xml"):

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="cdcatalog.xsl"?>
<catalog>
  <cd>
    <title>Empire Burlesque</title>
    <artist>Bob Dylan</artist>
    <country>USA</country>
    <company>Columbia</company>
    <price>10.90</price>
    <year>1985</year>
  </cd>
.
.
</catalog>
If you have an XSLT compliant browser it will nicely transform your XML into XHTML.
